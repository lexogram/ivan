<!-- YOUR HTML PAGE -->
<section id="html">
<h2>Your first HTML page</h2>
<div class="aside preview">On this page, you'll learn:
<ul>
<li>What an HTML page looks like</li>
<li>How to open a very simple HTML page in your browser</li>
</ul>
<a href="#" target="source">Download the source files</a>
</div>
<p>I'm assuming that you have never created an HTML page before. HTML means "HyperText Markup Language". This is what a very simple HTML page looks like:</p>
<pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;<span class="new">This appears in the tab / title bar</span>&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;<span class="new">This appears inside the browser window</span>&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>Here's how this HTML page looks in different browsers.</p>
<figure><img src="img/01_page.png" alt="screenshot of simple HTML page in different browsers"/>
<figcaption>Figure 1: How HTML &lt;title&gt; and &lt;body&gt; HTML elements appear in a browser</figcaption></figure>
You can discover what all these <code>&lt;tags&gt;</code> mean in the Understanding HTML Tags section at the end of page <a href="#game">6: Your game goes here</a>. But in fact, your browser will automatically create most of these tags if they are missing, so you can start with something even simpler, for now.</p>
<h3>Do It Yourself</h3>
<p>In the programming community, it is a tradition that your first program in any new language should display the words <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program#History">"hello world"</a>. To honour that tradition, you can create your own Hello World page and open it in <em>your</em> browser.</p>
<p>If you haven't already got a text editor, <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">download and install a trial copy of Sublime Text</a>. Open your text editor and create a new document. You can type <code>hello world</code></center> (or any other message you like), then save your file as <code>index.html</code>.</p>
<p>Find the file that you have just created on your desktop, and double-click on it. It should open in your favourite browser.</p>
<figure><img src="img/02_helloWorld.png" alt="A Hello World HTML page displayed in a browser" /><figcaption>Figure 2. A Hello World HTML page displayed in a Google Chrome</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Hello... Desktop</h3>
<p>Actually, the world can't see your message yet. This file that you saved on your local hard drive is only visible in your browser. Your next step will be to put an HTML file onto this server, so that anyone in the world can see it. To be precise, it will take you a total of 15 steps, including the ones that you have just taken. There will be clear instructions, explanations and screenshots to make sure that you find your way.</p>
<p class="aside next">If you are eager to continue building your game, click on the Next arrow below, or on item <a href="#git">3: Getting Git</a> in the menu on the left. Your Hello message should be online for the world to see when you have reach the end of page 5. If you need help or want to know more, click on optional sections below.</p>

On almost every page, you will find a button that allows you to Download The Source Files for that page. You might like to download these files into a separate project folder, and use them as a preview of what you will have achieved by the end of the section.
<p>If you get really stuck at any point, you can download my original files and use them to replace your own files, so that you can continue from a stable code base.</p></div>
<div class="aside tip">If you are using Sublime Text, you can use a shortcut to open your HTML file in a browser
<figure><img src="img/03_openInBrowser.png" alt="Sublime Text's right-click shortcut to open an HTML file in your browser" /><figcaption>Figure 3. Right-click on your document and choose Open In Browser</figcaption></figure>
</div>
<div class="aside info">
Why call your file <code>index.html</code>? In fact, you could call your html file anything you like. The fact that the first line is <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> tells your browser all it needs to know.<p>When you visit a site, if your browser doesn't ask for any particular file, the server on the site will send you <code>index.html</code> by default, if a file with that name exists. Unless you have a very good reason for using a different name, it is good practice to use <code>index.html</code></p></div>

<div>
<p class="symptom">Your HTML page is not appearing correctly in the browser. Perhaps one of these steps will help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are not using Sublime Text, perhaps your text editor is saving your files in a <code class="keyword">rich text</code> format, such as <code>.doc</code> or <code>.rtf</code>. Make sure that you are saving in a plain text format, using <code>.html</code> as the extension.</li>
<li>There may be many files called <code>index.html</code> on your computer. Make sure that you are opening the right one. If you are using Sublime Text, you can use the right-click &gt; Show in Browser shortcut, to be sure that you are opening the same document that you are working on.</li>

<p>GitHub is a meeting place for the open source community, where ideas are shared, where everyone can benefit from the energy and initiatives of others. A budding programmer like you has everything to gain from joining a community like this.</p>
<p>The Git application itself tracks the progress of your project. It creates a space for you make experiments, to make mistakes, to explore new possibilities without getting lost.</p>
<h3>git --version</h3>
<p>It's quite possible that git is already installed on your computer. To find out, <a href="/html/terminal.html">open a Terminal window</a> and type:</p>
<pre>git --version</pre>
<p>If all goes well, you should see something like the screenshot below.</p>

<h4>Installing Git: Windows</h4>
<p>Git is not installed by default on the Windows operating system. The easiest way to install it is to <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">download an installer</a>. When you click on the link, the download should start automatically.</p>
<p class="aside note">You can launch the installer application and simply click on the Next &gt; button, <strong>until you reach the screen Adjusting Your PATH Environment</strong>. (See image below). Here, it is best to select the Use Git From The Windows Command Prompt radio button. The Windows Command Prompt uses the Windows-standard <code>/</code> character in path names, which means that you can copy and paste path names from the Explorer windows, or drag files onto the Command Prompt window to paste their paths automatically into the window. Perhaps later, you will prefer to use the Git Bash application: selecting the second radio button, as shown in the image below, will allow you to choose the option you like best.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/04_installGitWindows.png" alt="" />
<figcaption>Figure 5. Choose - Use Git From The Windows Command Prompt</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4>Updating Git: Mac</h4>
<p>Git is installed by default on Mac OS X. However, older versions of the Mac operating system may have versions which are now considered obsolete. Mac OS 10.8 (Snow Leopard) for example, comes with version 1.7.4.4. Using this would cause an error if relied on it when following the instructions in section 5.</p>
<p>The Mac OS X operating system relies on its own version of Git for certain housekeeping tasks. As a result, is is better not to update the pre-installed version of Git.</p>
<p>A safer option is to install an up-to-date version of Git, and to use the newer version for all your work.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">download the most recent version of Git</a> from git-scm.com, and run the installer. However, when you run <code>git --version</code> in the Terminal window, you will probably see that the old version continues to be used.</p>
<p>To tell your Mac that you want to use the newer version, you need to execute some command line commands. Here are commands that I use on Mac OS 10.8.5 after running the Git installer for version 2.3.5:</p>
<pre class="revised"><span class="new">git --version</span>
git version 1.7.4.4
<span class="new">which git</span>
/usr/bin/git</pre>
<p>The original version is still active. It as located in a hidden folder. The Git installer places the new version in a different hidden file. The next command tells Mac OS X where to find the newer version. The following commands confirm that the newer version is now active.</p>
<pre>
<span class="new">PATH=/usr/local/git/bin:$PATH</span>
<span class="new">which git</span>
/usr/local/git/bin/git
<span class="new">git --version</span>
git version 2.3.5

<label for="git-detail">Understanding Terminal Commands</label>
<div>
<h4>Command Line Tools</h4>
<p>You probably have plenty of experience using a mouse in a point-and-click <span class="keyword">graphic user interface</span> (GUI). You are used to double-clicking on files to open them, and dragging them from one folder to another, to move them. You are used to opening an application when you want to send an email, edit a photo or listen to music. There is always visual feedback on the screen to tell you, a human, what is happening. Even if it's only an endless progress bar.</p>
<p>And yet, at any given time, there are many applications running on your computer which do not appear anywhere on the screen. These are the <span class="keyword">command-line tools</span> (CLT).</p>
<p>When you go to a restaurant, you see the waiters who come to your table, with their little notebooks, but you do not normally see the cooks. Without the cooks, however, the restaurant would fail.</p>
<p>When you type a command into a Terminal window, you can imagine that you are talking directly to the cooks that produce all the goodness. The Terminal window is the equivalent of a waiter's notebook.</p>
<p>The operating system itself takes care of some commands, like <code>cd&nbsp;</code>. Other commands need a special <span class="strike">chef</span>  CLT application to take care of them, so you need to refer to the name of the application first. For example, <code>git --version</code> tells the application <code>git</code> (which has no window that you can see on the screen) to send back information about which <code>version</code> it is.</p>
<h4>Git commands</h4>
<p>To see all the commands that <code>git</code> can understand, you can type <code>git --help</code>.</p>
<p>For information on all these commands, you can refer to <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs">the official documentation</a>. However, this information can be overwhelming. Each time a <code>git</code> command is first used in this tutorial, you will find more information about how to use it in the optional sections at the foot of this page.</p>

<h4>Using Git in other ways</h4>
<p class="aside tip">You can use the Git application to work with many different sites that provide version control hosting. Some examples are: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> and <a href="https://launchpad.net/">Launchpad</a>. Other sites that help you to create applications in the cloud, such as <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> and <a href="https://c9.io/">Cloud 9</a> offer integration with GitHub.<br /><br />You can find a list of hosted version control services on <a href="http://www.slant.co/topics/153/~what-is-the-best-hosted-version-control-service">slant.co</a></p>
<h4>Copy and Paste in the Windows Command Prompt</h4>
<p class="aside tip">The standard keyboard shortcuts like <code>Ctrl-C</code> and <code>Ctrl-Z</code> were introduced by Apple in 1984 and were adopted in Windows applications only much later. The Windows Command Prompt uses an older keyboard shortcut system. In the Windows Command Prompt, you will need to use <code>Alt-Spacebar</code> to show a contextual menu, and then press the letter that appears underlined in the menu item that you want to use.<br /><br />For example, to select text, you can press <code>Alt-Spacebar</code> then E (for <code><span class="under">E</span>dit</code>), then M (for <code><span class="under">M</span>ark</code>). You can now use the arrow keys to move the selection around and extend it. Pressing Enter will copy the highlighted text to your clipboard. Use <code>Alt-Spacebar <span class="under">E</span>dit</code>, <code><span class="under">P</span>aste</code> to paste your text.</p>

<p>Now you're ready to open a GitHub acccount. This wont't take long (although finding a username that you like and that isn't already taken can be time-consuming). I've used the name "blackslate" in my examples.</p>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://github.com/join">Join GitHub</a> page, and fill in the form.</p>
<p class="aside note">At the time of writing, Git requires you to use only the characters <code>A-Z</code>, <code>a-z</code> and <code>-</code> (hyphens) for your username and for the names of your projects. Names with other punctuation, special characters, accents or non-Roman letters, like <span class="gold">!android_</span> or <span class="gold">Andréa</span> or <span class="gold">Андрей</span>, are not permitted.</p>
<p>The first page asks for a username and an email address that are not currently registered on GitHub. It will also ask you to enter a password. At the beginning, at least, you will be typing this username and password often.</p>

<p>The most important thing to do now is to <strong>copy the URL for your new GitHub repository</strong>. You can do this by clicking on the Copy To Clipboard button, as shown in Figure 10 above. You'll need to paste this URL into a Terminal window in the next step.</p>
<p class="aside next">Your immediate aim is to get your Hello World page online, so I propose to take an unconventional shortcut. If you want to know what the conventional path is, then you can read the Branches and Pages section below. If you want to move along quickly, just click on the Next arrow below, or on item <a href="#branch">5: Creating a branch</a> in the menu on the left.</p>

<div class="optional details">

<label for="github-details">Branches and Pages</label>
<div>
<p>In this tutorial, you will be following a path that has already been prepared for you, taking predictable steps to recreate something that already exists. This is reassuring, but it is not how you will be working in the future.</p>
<p>When you start working on your first real project, you will be creating something that is different from anything anyone else has ever made before. There will be no clear path; there will be many possible paths that you can follow. You will not know in advance which ones will bring you to a dead end, and which ones will lead you to where you plan to go. You may not even be entirely sure where your journey will lead you. The original creators of iTunes were probably focused on playing music; they did not imagine that their project would develop into a shopping mall.</p>
<p>The purpose of Git is to allow you to explore many possible paths at the same time. You can test two different techniques for achieving the same result, and then decide which is better. Different developers can move off in different directions, each creating something new, and then the whole team can discuss which approach is likely to be the best way forward. Perhaps later, you will discover something that makes you realize that one of the abandoned paths is in fact the right one to take.</p>
<p>Git allows you to keep track of all the paths that anyone in the team has followed. It allows you bring all the best discoveries from the secondary paths, and to weave them all together into a single strand.</p>
<p>Git uses a mixed bag of words to describe this process. It uses words like <span class="keyword">branch</span>, <span class="keyword">fork</span>, <span class="keyword">clone</span>, <span class="keyword">checkout</span>, <span class="keyword">merge</span>, <span class="keyword">push</span> and <span class="keyword">pull</span>. You can find a full list of all the keywords used by Git <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs">here</a>.</p>
<h4>Branches</h4>
<p>As a rule, you start a project with a single branch called <span class="keyword">master</span>. The master branch will contain only code that has been tested extensively, to ensure that it is stable. Each time you want to make a change (which might not be so stable), you create a new branch, and you work on that. Let's imagine that you call the new branch <span class="keyword">develop</span>. When you first create the develop branch, it is identical to the master branch. When you have tested your new code and have decided that the develop branch is stable, you can merge the changes back into the master branch, like one arm of a river flowing back into the main channel. After each new merge, the master branch and the develop branch might again be identical. You can continue working in the develop branch, and make additional branches from that. Your additional branches may be for proposed bug fixes, for new features and for experiments.</p>

<figcaption>Figure 11. The multiple paths or <span class="keyword">branches</span> in a project repository</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can give your branches any name you like (so long as they only use the 53 permitted characters). Normally, you would use a name that describes the change you are about to make.</p>
<h4>Pages</h4>
<p>While you are working on a project, it is often helpful to maintain a web site to let people know what you are doing, how they can help, and how your project can help them. GitHub has used a neat technique that allows you to integrate your web site into your GitHub repository itself.</p>
<p><strong>If you create a special branch called <span class="keyword">gh-pages</span> (short for GitHub pages), and you place a file named <code>index.html</code> in the root folder of the branch, then GitHub will automatically treat the gh-pages branch as a web site.</strong></p>
<p>You can find more information about this at <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<p>To get your first project online as quickly as possible, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a repository (as you have just done) and leave it empty. If it is empty, it has no master branch.</li>
<li>Create a gh-pages branch (as you are about to do) and use it for all your development.</li>
<li>Create secondary branches, as your work progresses, and merge them back into the gh-pages branch when you are ready.</li>
</ul>
<p>Telling the world about your project is the best way to find people who are willing to help you. In future projects, you will know how to create a strong web presence, right from the beginning. In future projects, you will know to use the <span class="keyword">master</span> branch for your main development.</p>

<p>You've just created an empty repository, like a dry river bed. And now I'm going to show you how to make a special <span class="keyword">branch</span> from this repository. This is much easier to do when the repository is still empty.</p>
<p class="aside kudos">Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cmrberry">Rachel Berry</a> of GitHub for pointing out this technique to me.</p>

<p>The next few instructions may seem a little like magic to you for now, but you will soon make sense of them. In the Understanding Cloning section below, you can read up about the <code>git</code> commands that you will be using.</p>
<p class="aside tip">One of the commands you will be using is <code>commit</code>. This requires you to include a note to describe what you have changed. I am guessing that you are not familiar with command line text editors, so I strongly recommend that you configure Git to use Sublime Text as its default text editor. You can find instructions for this in the Tips and Tricks section below. You will be thankful you did this when you reach section 7: Reverting changes.</p>
<p>Here's what you need to do:</p>

<li><strong>On your desktop, create an empty folder</strong> in the place where you would like to save your new project. I have called my folder <code>nim</code>. It might be easier for you if you do the same.</li>
<li><strong><a href="html/terminal.html">Open a Terminal window</a></strong>. You're going to type 9 commands in all. First you are going to create a command that gives the Terminal control of your new <code>nim</code> folder. You'll create the command in three separate stages. The complete command might look something like this:<br />
<code>cd /Users/james/nim</code></li>
<ol>
<li><strong>Type <code>cd&nbsp;</code></strong> (that's "cd " followed by a space). This means <span class="keyword">change directory</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Drag the icon of your <code>nim</code> folder onto the Terminal window</strong>. This will automatically insert the path to your folder after the <code>cd&nbsp;</code> that you have just typed.</li>
<li><strong>Press the Enter key</strong> to execute the command. The Terminal now has power over what happens in your <code>nim</code> folder.</li>
</ol>
</ul>

<figure>
<img src="img/10_cdCommand.png" alt="" />
<figcaption>Figure 12. Using the <code>cd</code> command in a Terminal window</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li>Still in the Terminal window:</li>
<ol>
<li><strong>Type: <code>git clone&nbsp;</code></strong> (with a space after "clone")</li>
<li><strong>Paste in the URL that you copied</strong> at the end of the last step</li>
<li><strong>Add a space and <code>&nbsp;gh-pages</code></strong>. The complete command might look something like this, except that you will use your own username instead of "blackslate":<br /><code>git clone https://github.com/<strong>blackslate</strong>/nim.git gh-pages</code></li>
<li><strong>Press the Enter key</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</ul>

<p class="aside note">On Windows, the standard Ctrl-V keyboard shortcut may not work in a Command Prompt window. You may need to right-click, then select Paste from the contextual menu.</p>
<p>Inside your <code>nim</code> folder you should now see a folder named <code>gh-pages</code>. The clone command should have copied into it all the contents of your new repository on the GitHub server (in other words, nothing, since your new repository is still empty). The output in the Terminal should look something like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/11_clone.png" alt="" />
<figcaption>Figure 13. Using <code>git clone</code> to create a local repository.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <code>git clone</code> command also created an invisible folder called <code>.git</code> inside the new <code>gh-pages</code> folder, as you can see in Figure 14 below. This contains all the data that the Git application needs to keep track of the changes that you make to your project.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/12_invisibleGit.png" alt="" />
<figcaption>Figure 14. The contents of the invisible <code>.git</code> folder</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="aside tip">To learn how to make "invisible" files visible on your computer, you can read the Tips and Tricks section below.</p>
<p>Now for some more command line magic. (Do you remember what the <code>cd&nbsp;</code> command does?)</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Terminal window, <strong>type the following 3 commands</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<pre>cd gh-pages
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git status</pre>
<p>To understand what the <code>checkout --orphan</code> command does, see the Understanding Git Commands section below. The <code>git status</code> command is one that you will use often. It lists all the files that you have changed, before you <span class="keyword">commit</span> the changes to Git's memory system.</p>
<p>Here's how your Terminal window might look now:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/13_orphanBranch.png" alt="" />
<figcaption>Figure 15. Checking out a new <span class="keyword">orphan</span> branch of your project</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Just a few more actions, and you'll see your Hello World web page online.</p>
<ul>
<li>On your computer desktop, find the <code>index.html</code> file that you made in step 2, and <strong>drag or copy your <code>index.html</code> file into your new <code>gh-pages</code> folder</strong>.</li>
<li>In the Terminal window, run the <code>git status</code> command again. You'll see that Git is aware of the change that you have made.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="img/14_status.png" alt="" />
<figcaption>Figure 16. The <code>status</code> of your project is updated each time you make a change.</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>Now you're going to tell Git that you are confident about the changes that you have made. In the Terminal window, <strong>type the following 3 commands</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<pre>git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit to the gh-pages branch"
git push origin gh-pages
</pre>
<figure>
<img src="img/15_commit.png" alt="" />
<figcaption>Figure 17. Pushing your changes to the remote GitHub repository</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Git will ask you for the username and password that you registered when you created your Git account. When you type your password in the Terminal window, no characters will appear. Press Enter when you're done.</p>
<p>That's it! Now you can visit your new web site. <strong>In your browser, type in the URL for your GitHub site</strong>. For me, it will be:</p>
<a href="http://blackslate.github.io/nim/">http://blackslate.github.io/nim/</a>
<p>For you, if you called your repository "nim", then all you have to do is replace my "blackslate" username with your own username.</p>
<p>http://<strong>&lt;yourUserName&gt;</strong>.github.io/nim/</p>

<label for="branch-details">Understanding Git Commands</label>
<div>
Here are the <code>git</code> commands that you have just used:
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone"><code>git clone</code></a></dt>
<dd>The <code>clone</code> command copies <em>everything</em> from a given repository to the directory that your Terminal window is currently controlling. (In this case, there was in fact <em>nothing</em> to copy). Your command looked something like this:<br />
<code>git clone https://github.com/blackslate/nim.git gh-pages</code><br />The directory name <code>gh-pages</code> is optional. If you had not included it, the command would have created a directory called <code>nim</code>, using the same name as the remote repository. The <code>clone</code> command also creates a new branch in your local repository, but this branch doesn't have a name yet.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout"><code>git checkout</code></a></dt>
<dd>Before you used the <code>git checkout</code> command, you told your Terminal window to focus its attention on your new <code>gh-pages</code> directory, by executing the command <code>cd gh-pages</code>.Your command looked like this:<br />
<code>git checkout --orphan gh-pages</code><br />
The <code>checkout</code> command said "Prepare all the files in this folder as the files that I am currently working on." The <code>--orphan</code> <span class="keyword">option</span> said "The files in this branch are to be treated completely separately from any files in any other branch". In other words, if you had a <span class="keyword">master</span> branch for your main development, the branch that you are now checking out would be totally unrelated to it. The <code>gh-pages</code> branch name at the end of the command tells Git what you want to call this new branch.  If you look at the page for your repository on GitHub, you'll find that it now has a <code>gh-pages</code> branch.
<figure>
<img src="gh-pagesBranch" alt="A new branch in your GitHub repository" />
<figcaption>Figure 19. Using <code>checkout ... <span class="keyword">branch-name</span></code> creates a new branch in your project.</figcaption>
</figure>
</dd>
<dt><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status"><code>git status</code></a></dt>
<dd>The <code>git status</code> lists all the changes that you have made. There are 4 separate places where your work is tracked:
<ul>
<li>In the folder where you are currently making changes (your <span class="keyword">workspace</span></li>
<li>In an index of all the files whose changes you are tracking</li>
<li>In your local repository, on the computer you are working on now</li>
<li>In the remote repository, stored on the GitHub servers</li>
</ul>
<figure>

<p class="aside kudos">Credit: <a href="http://blog.osteele.com/posts/2008/05/my-git-workflow/">Oliver Steele</a></p>
</figure>

<p>The <code>status</code> command tells you the differences between the local repository and the index (on the one hand) and your workspace (on the other). The first time you used it, there were no differences, because you had made no changes. The second time, you had just added your <code>index.html</code> file, and you had not yet told Git about it, so it was <span class="keyword">untracked</span> at that time.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add"><code>git add</code></a></dt>
<dd>The plain <code>git add</code> command tells Git that you want to track changes to the files listed by <code>git status</code>. You can choose to add only specific files, if you wish. Files that have been <code>add</code>ed to Git are said to be <span class="keyword">staged</span>. The <code>-A</code> option says "Add all files that have changed, and remove all files that have been deleted". If you do not use <code>-A</code> then deleted files will be ignored. In this case, there are no deleted files to remove from Git's staging area.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit"><code>git commit</code></a></dt>
<dd>The <code>commit</code> command moves changed items from the staging area to the local repository. You can move changed items directly to the repository without passing through the staging area by using <code>git commit -a</code>. In this case, you don't need to use the <code>git add</code> command.<br />The <code>-m</code> option allows you to include a message to explain what it is that you are committing. In my example, the message was <code>"Initial commit to the gh-pages branch"</code>. If you don't include <code>-m</code> then Git will open a text editor for you to enter the message. By default, this will be a command-line text editor, in the Terminal window itself. See the Tips and Tricks section below to learn how to set up Sublime Text as Git's preferred text editor... or simply use the <code>-m</code> option every time.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push"><code>git push</code></a></dt>
<dd>Up until this point, all the changes have been made on your local computer. The <code>git push</code> command tells Git to send all the changed files to the remote repository on the GitHub server. When you did this, the <code>index.html</code> will have appeared in your GitHub page in your browser (you may need to refresh the page first.
<figure>
<img src="index-html" alt="index.html becomes visible on GitHub" />
<figcaption>Figure 21. <code>git push</code> makes your files visible in the remote repository</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>By default, your local repository is called <code>origin</code>. You have just created and checked out a remote branch called <code>gh-pages</code>.Using plain <code>git push</code> will assume that you mean <code>git push origin gh-pages</code>, but it is best to be explicit each time, just to be sure that Git is not making different assumptions from you.</p>

<h4>Using Sublime Text to create <code>commit</code> and <code>revert</code> messages</h4>
<div class="aside tip">Windows:
<p>If you used the default installation settings when you installed Sublime Text, you can use the following command in the Command Prompt window:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sublime Text 3 <br /><code>git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/sublime text 3/subl.exe' -w"</code></li>
<li>Sublime Text 2 <br /><code>git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/sublime text 2/sublime_text.exe' -w"</code></li>
</ul>
<p>When you have done this, each time you execute a <code>commit</code> command without using the <code>-m</code> option, a new document will open in Sublime Text with the title COMMIT_EDITMSG. You can edit this message, save it and close it, and then Git will continue with the commit process. If you change your mind about your commit, you can close the message without saving it, or delete all its contents before you save and close it. If Git sees an empty message, it will cancel the commit process.</p>

    &lt;p&gt;This appears inside the browser window&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>You can use this as a template for the web page that will be the home for your game. You can copy this text and paste it into your <code>index.html</code> file in the <code>nim/gh-pages</code> folder that you created in the last section. You can make a couple of changes to it, to make it more relevant:</p>
<pre class="revised">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

</pre>
<p>Save the file, and open it in your browser. If you don't see what you expect to see, check the Troubleshooting section below. If all is well, you can use Git to push your well-formatted HTML page to the GitHub server.</p>
<p>In your Terminal window:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the Terminal is focused on the folder that contains your <code>index.html</code> file. If you're not sure, type <code>cd&nbsp;</code> and then the path to the folder. Remember that you can drag the folder's icon onto the Terminal window, to paste its path automatically.</li>
<li>As a sanity check, type <code>git status</code>. The terminal window should show that index.html has been modified.

<p>If you want to know more about the HTML tags you have been using, click on Understanding HTML Tags below.</p>
</div>

<div class="optional details">
<input type="checkbox" id=""/>
<label for="html-details">Understanding HTML Tags</label>
<div>
<p>You can recognize HTML code because of the <span class="keyword">tags</span> that it uses. Tags are instructions that are enclosed in <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> pointed <span class="keyword">angle brackets</span>, in this style: <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>.</p>
<h4>Closing Tags</h4>
<p>Most HTML tags come in matching pairs, with an <span class="keyword">opening</span> and a <span class="keyword">closing</span> tag. Closing tags contain a forward slash <code>/</code> character, followed by the first word of the matching opening tag. The expression to describe a pair of matching tags, plus all the data between them, is <span class="keyword">HTML element</span>. In the example above, you can see the following pairs of tags, creating five different HTML elements.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>&lt;html&gt;...&lt;/html&gt;</code></dt>
<dd><p>This tells the browser to treat all the information between these tags as HTML code. There should always be an opening <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag at the beginning of an HTML document, and a closing <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code> tag at the end.</p>
<p>There should only be one <code>html</code> element in an HTML file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>&lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;</code></dt>
<dd><p>The <code>head</code> element contains instructions to the browser that are not shown inside the browser window. In sections <a href="css">11</a> and <a href="js">12</a>, you will add instructions to tell the browser where to find additional files to download. The <code>head</code> can also contain information for search engines that summarize the contents of the page.</p></dd>
<dt><code>&lt;title&gt;...&lt;/title&gt;</code></dt>
<dd><p>As you can see from the screen shot in figure 1, the text inside the <code>title</code> element appears in the title bar of the browser window, or as a label in the tab for the current page.</p>
<p>Search engines like <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.yandex.com">Yandex</a> and <a href="http://www.baidu.com">Baidu</a> use the text in the <code>title</code> element to understand the main purpose of the page.</p></dd>
<dt><code>&lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt;</code></dt>
<dd><p>The <code>body</code> element contains everything that will appear inside the browser window. There should only be one <code>body</code> element.</p></dd>
<dt><code>&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</code></dt>
<dd>This indicates a paragraph of text.</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Self-closing Tags</h4>
<p>Some tags, such as <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> are <span class="keyword">self-closing</span>. A self-closing tag stands on its own, with no matching tag to close it later. Self-closing tags are typically used for elements that cannot have text inside then. For example</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code></dt>
<dd>The very first line of an HTML file tells the browser what kind of file it is. Browsers can read many kinds of files: XML files, which contain arrays of data, SVG files which contain the formulae needed to draw smooth Scalable Vector Graphics, image files such as JPG and PNG, and many more.</dd>
<dt><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></dt>
<dd>The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag tells the browser where to find a file that displays an image. You will be working with the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag in section <a href="#image">8: Adding an image.</a></dd>
<dt><code>&lt;link&gt;</code></dt>
<dd>The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag tells the browser where to find a file that gives rules on the appearance and layout of the web page. You will be using the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in section <a href="#css">11: Styling with CSS.</a></dd>
<dt><code>&lt;input&gt;</code></dt>
<dd>The <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag lets you create elements such as buttons and editable fields that allow the visitor to interact with your page. You will be adding a checkbox <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> to your page in section <a href="#toggle">21: Showing the rules.</a></dd>
<dt><code>&lt;meta&gt;</code></dt>
<dd>The <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag can be used to tell the browser and bots that visit your site what your page is about, what language it's in, how it should be categorized in search engines. You will be adding a <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> in section <a href="#meta">26: Invisible data</a>.</dd>

<p class="aside tip">As you saw in your Hello World test, if a file has an <code>.html</code> extension, most modern browsers will treat everything inside it as HTML, even if there is no <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element, if there is more than one <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element, or if there is text outside the <code>html</code> element. Modern browsers may also display content correctly even if the <code>body</code> is missing, or if there is more than one <code>body</code> element. Nonetheless, it is good practice to use these elements correctly. Other developers will notice if your code is badly written.</p>
<p class="aside tip">The browser will not display any text between an opening angle bracket <code>&lt;</code> character and a closing angle bracket <code>&gt;</code>. If you use a tag that the browser does not recognize, such as <code>&lt;unofficial_tag&gt;</code>, the browser will simply ignore it. Older browsers may ignore tags that were officially introduced after they were released.</p>

<!-- REVERTING YOUR CHANGES -->
<section id="revert">
<h2>Reverting changes</h2>
<div class="aside preview">On this page, you'll learn:
<ul>
<li>How to see what changes you have made, using Git</li>
<li>How to check what the project looked like at a previous stage</li>
<li>How to revert changes you have made</li>
<li>How to rewrite your history of changes</li>
</ul>
<a href="#" target="source">Download the source files</a>
</div>
<p>In you <code>index.html</code> file, the words "Hello World!" have gone. The change that you have just made moves your project forward. But let's imagine for a moment that it creates a problem, and that you want to get back to your "Hello World" version of the file. How can you do that?</p>
<p>Git provides 3 commands: <code>checkout</code>, <code>revert</code> and <code>reset</code>, of increasing power. You've already used <code>checkout</code> command to create the <code>gh-pages</code> branch in your repository. You can use a different flavour of it now to look at your project the way it was in the past, without disturbing its current state.</p>
<h3>git log</h3>
<p>In the Terminal window type the following command:</p>
<pre>git log</pre>
<figure>
<img src="git-log" alt="the git log command" />
<figcaption>Figure 27. The <code>git log</code> command gives a unique name for each <code>commit</code></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You will see the history of the <code>commit</code>s that you have made, starting with the most recent. Each <code>commit</code> has a unique 32-character name. You don't need to memorize this.</p>
<h3>git checkout</h3>
<p>To see what your project looked like at the moment of a particular <code>commit</code> you can type the command <code>git checkout xxxxxxx</code>, where xxxxxxx represents the first 7 characters in the commit name. In my case, to return to my Hello World state, I can type:</p>
<pre>git checkout e6b50f7</pre>
<figure>
<img src="checkoutHello" alt="Using git checkout to view an earlier stage in the project" />
<figcaption>Figure 28. Using <code>git checkout</code> to view an earlier stage in the project</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Git restores my entire project (in this case, just the <code>index.html</code> file) to the state it was in after my first commit. If I open <code>index.html</code> in my text editor, and refresh it in my browser, I can see that I am back to Hello World.</p>
<p>This change is only temporary. I can get back to where I was before by checking out the most recent <code>commit</code>:</p>
<pre>git checkout b6d433d</pre>
<figure>
<img src="checkOutGameHere" alt="checking out the most recent <code>commit" />
<figcaption>Figure 29. Checking out the most recent <code>commit</code></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can try this for yourself. It's safe to do it now, right at the beginning of your project. If the worst comes to the worst, you can always delete everything you've done, and you need only 15 steps to get back to where you are now.</p>
<h3>git revert</h3>
<p>The <code>git revert xxxxxxx</code> command is more powerful. It is not an "undo" command, but its effect is to undo all the changes made by the chosen commit, but . In fact, it creates a new <code>commit</code> that resets the state of your project to the way it was earlier. This action adds a new element to the history of your project. If you change your mind, you can then revert the previous <code>revert</code>. You can <code>revert</code> back to any point in the past, and all the intervening changes will still be safely stored, for you to revert to if you need to.</p>
<p class="aside note">Before testing the <code>revert</code> command, I strongly recommend that you configure Git to use Sublime Text as its preferred text editor. You can find instructions for this in the Tips and Tricks section at the bottom of page <a href="#branch">5: Creating a branch</a>. If you don't do this, you might need to use the Troubleshooting section below to find out how to manage the command line text editor that Git uses by default.</p>
<p>If you have set up Git to use Sublime Text as the default text editor, you might like to test this command now. </p>
<ul>
<li>Check the <code>git log</code> that you made earlier for the name of the most recent commit</li>
<li>Run the command <code>git revert </code> + the first 7 characters in the name. For me, this would be:<br /> <code>git revert b6d433d</code>. The name that you use will be different.</li>
<li>Git will now open a text editor for you to create a message explaining why you are reverting to a previous version. If you have configured Git to use Sublime Text as its preferred text editor, you should see something like Figure XX below.
<figure>
<img src="revert-commit-message.png" alt="you must provide a commit message when you use the revert command" />
<figcaption>Figure 30. You must provide a <code>commit</code>  message when you use the <code>revert</code> command</figcaption>
</figure></li>
<li>Type something like <code>Testing the revert command</code>, save the document and close it.</li>
<li>In the Terminal window, run the <code>git log</code> command again. You will see that there is now a new commit.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you open your <code>index.html</code> file now, either in your text editor or in your browser, you will see that everything is back to its Hello World state. If you continued working now, and made a new commit, your "game will go here" version would be ignored. But it would not be forgotten. You would be able to <code>revert</code> to it at any time, if you wanted.</p>
<h3>git reset</h3>
<p>Actually, you want to restore your "game will go here" version, and continue working from that point. You can now do one of two things.</p>
<ol>
<li>You could revert your most recent <code>commit</code> action (which was just created by the <code>revert</code> command). If you do this, you will add another <code>commit</code> to your history. If there were other developers working on the project, this would be the best thing to do, so that a permanent trace of all your actions is recorded</li>
<li>You can execute the dangerous <code>reset</code> command.</li>
</ol>
<p class="aside warn">The <code>reset</code> command can be dangerous, because it can destroy data without checking first. If you have made changes to your files, or created new files, these changes and these files will be erased permanently, without warning.</p>
<p>In this case, all you will be deleting is the  most recent <code>commit</code> action, the one you just created by using <code>revert</code>, so you will be back exactly where you want to be.</p>
<p>In the Terminal window, type <code>git reset --hard&nbsp;</code> and then the first characters of the commit that you made after the "game will go here" edit. In my case, this command looks like this:</p>
<pre>git reset --hard b6d433d
</pre>
<p>Your command will have a different name at the end.</p>
<p>If you now run <code>git log</code>, you will see that you have changed your history: there are now only 2 commits recorded. The third one has gone forever.</p>
<figure>
<img src="reset.png" alt="using reset to change your history" />

<div class="aside next">
Now you know Git's <code>add</code>, <code>commit</code> and <code>push</code> commands, to get your project moving forwards, and also the <code>checkout</code>, <code>revert</code> and <code>reset</code> commands, to undo what you have done. However, your game doesn't do anything at all yet. It's time to address this issue.

<p>You've been working at this for some time now, but your game is still... let's say <em>a little disappointing</em>. No images, no interaction, no artificial intelligence. You might like to take a look at <a href="complete/">the game you are getting ready to write</a>, and make a note of what needs to be done to get from where you are now to where you want to be. Here are some of the things that you might note:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add images of matches</li>
<li>Arrange the images in rows</li>
<li>Show the player that the images are interactive</li>
<li>Hide each image when you click on it</li>
<li>Add a button so that the current player can say "Your turn"</li>
<li>Show which player is currently playing</li>
<li>Add buttons to restart the game</li>
<li>Show the rules when the game first loads</li>
<li>Create a computer player that is smart enough to win</li>

This image is available to use with a Creative Commons licence. You can find the original high-resolution source image <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Match-1.jpg">here.</a> You can read more about Creative Commons in the optional sections below.</p>
<h3>Save the image</h3>
<p>To use this image for your game, you first need to save it to your <code>nim</code> folder. It is good practice to keep different kinds of files separate. I recommend that you create a folder called <code>img</code> alongside your <code>index.html</code> file, and that you save the match image in this folder. (You'll see in a moment why I suggest that you name the folder <code>img</code>.)</p>
<p>To save the image:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click on the image in your browser</li>
<li>In the contextual menu that opens, choose "Save Image As..." (The wording may be slightly different in your browser).</li>
</ul>

<figcaption>Figure 32. Save the match.png image to the nim/img/ folder</figcaption>

<h3>Show the image in your page</h3>
<p>To show the image in your HTML page, you can replace the line...</p>
<pre>  &lt;p&gt;<span class="new">The game will go here</span>&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
<p>... as shown below, then save your file.</p>
<pre class="revised">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

    <span class="new">&lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match" /&gt;</span>
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>Refresh your <code>index.html</code> page in your browser, or reopen it, and check if the image appears. If not, you can check the Troubleshooting section below. If all has gone well, you can upload your changes to the GitHub server.</p>

<h3>Upload the changes to the GitHub server</h3>
<p>In the Terminal window:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the Terminal is focused on the folder that contains your <code>index.html</code> file. If you're not sure, type <code>cd&nbsp;</code> and then the path to the folder.</li>
<li>Run the command <code>git status</code> to check that Git knows that your <code>index.html</code> file has changed, that you have added a folder called <code>img</code> and that you have added a file called <code>match.png</code> to the <code>img/</code> folder.</li>
<li>Run the command <code>git add -A</code> to tell Git to record your changes in the index (staging area).</li>
<li>Run the command <code>git commit -m "Add img/match.png; modified index.html to show this image"</code>. Alternatively you can run just <code>git commit</code> type your commit message in the text editor that opens, then save the document and close it so that Git can continue.</li>
<li>Run the command <code>git push origin gh-pages</code> and enter your username and password details when asked. This will upload your new version of your project to the GitHub server.</li>
</ul>
<p>You (and everyone else in the world) should now be able to see your match image on your online web page.</p>

<h4>The &lt;img /&gt; tag</h4>
<p>An <code>img</code> HTML tag is self closing. There is no closing <span class="red">&lt;/img&gt;</span> tag. You will often see it with a <code>/</code> character just before the closing <code>&gt;</code> angle bracket. This is not essential, but it helps remind you that no closing tag is needed.</p>
<p> No image will appear unless the tag contains a <code>src</code> (source) <span class="keyword">attribute</span>, inside the angle brackets. An <code>img</code> tag should normally also have an <code>alt</code> (alternative) attribute (see below). Other attributes such as <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are also common.</p>
<h4>src</h4>
<p>The <code>src</code> (source) attribute tells the browser where to find the image. This can be an either:</p>
<ul>
<li>an <span class="keyword">absolute path</span> that uniquely identifies the file on the whole of the Internet, such as <code><a href="http://lexogram.github.io/openbook/nim/complete/img/match.png">http://lexogram.github.io/openbook/nim/complete/img/match.png</a></code></li>
<li>a <span class="keyword">relative path</span> indicating the how to find the image if you start in the folder that contains the HTML page itself. If the HTML page is in a folder called <code>nim/</code> and an image called <code>match.png</code> is in a folder called <code>nim/img/</code>, then the relative path will be <code>img/match.png</code>.</li>
</ul></p>
<h4>alt</h4>
<p>The <code>alt</code> attribute is important in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It provides an on-screen text label, describing the image, if the image itself cannot be found</li>
<li>It provides screen readers (for people who have difficulty seeing) with a description that can be read aloud by a synthesized voice.</li>
</ul>
<p class="aside info">For a mini tutorial on the <code>img</code> tag, see <a href="">the w3schools site</a></p>
<h4>Fetching images</h4>
<p>When you visit a web site, your browser asks the remote server for an HTML file, such as the <code>index.html</code> page that you are working with now.. This file contains nothing but text. The HTML tags are text, the attributes of the tags are text, and the content inside the elements are text. There are no images.</p>
<p>The browser reads the HTML page from top to bottom. If it encounters an <code>img</code> tag with a <code>src</code> attribute, it will send a new request to the server for the image file. The server may reply: "404: I can't find the file you asked for", or it may send the image file back to your browser. Your browser can then show the image.</p>
<h4>Image <code>width</code> and <code>height</code></h4>
<p>A big image may take a long time to arrive. Until it does arrive, the browser will not know how big it is going to be, so it will not be able to create the appropriate amount of space for it.</p>
<p>It is good practice to include <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes inside each <code>img</code> tag, so that the browser can prepare a place in the page for all images. If you don't do this, you may see the other content of the page shifting as new images arrive.</p>
<p>Ideally, the <code>img</code> tag for your match should look like this:</p>
<pre>  &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match" <span class="new">width="12" height="125"</span> /&gt;</pre>
<p>In this tutorial, for simplicity, I have left this out. The only image you are using is only 3 KB, and it should arrive fast enough for you to see no shift in the contents of the page.</p>

<li>HTML links are Case Sensitive. This means that "link" is not the same as "LINK" or "Link". Check if you have used any UPPERCASE letters when you named the match image file or the folder it is in. The names of the folder and the file should use the same case as the <code>src</code> path that you have created. If your path is <code>src="img/match.png"</code> then the folder 
should be called "img" and the image itself should be called "match.png".</li>
<li>Perhaps you have not stored the image inside a folder called <code>img</code>, which is where you HTML page is looking for it.</li>
<li>Perhaps you are using a different image, and you have called it "match.jpg" or "match.gif".

<p>Showing 2 matches in your web page is as easy as showing one. You can simply copy and paste the line that you have just changed:</p>

  &lt;/body&gt;

<img src="16-matches.png" alt="16 img tags shows 16 matches in the browser" />
<figcaption>Fig XX. 16 <code>img</code> tags shows 16 matches in the browser</figcaption>

<p>By default, your browser will attempt to place all <code>img</code> elements side by side. Since your match image is very thin, it has no difficulty doing this. However, you want to display the matches in 4 separate rows, because that's the way the game works.</p>
<p>You can use a different HTML tag - <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> - to <span class="keyword">div</span>ide the <code>img</code> elements into separate blocks. By default, your browser will place all <code>div</code> elements one below the other. Unlike <code>img</code> elements, <code>div</code> elements need both an opening <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and a closing <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> tag. Here's how you can arrange your HTML code to produce four rows of matches, with the right number of matches in each row:</p>

<pre class="revised">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Nim&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    <span class="new">&lt;div&gt;</span>
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match<span class="new"> 1 row 1</span>" /&gt;
      <span class="new">&lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 2 row 1" /&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 3 row 1" /&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 4 row 1" /&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 5 row 1" /&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 6 row 1" /&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 7 row 1" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 1 row 2" /&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 2 row 2" /&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 3 row 2" /&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 4 row 2" /&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 5 row 2" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 1 row 3" /&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 2 row 3" /&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 3 row 3" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 1 row 4" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;</span>
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>You'll notice that I've edited the <code>alt</code> texts for each match, to indicate which position and row it lies in. This means that someone who is using a screen reader to play your game will be able to visualize the layout from the <code>alt</code> text alone.</p>

<p>In fact, since you already asked for the image in your previous version of this page, it is likely that your browser will say to itself: "Hey, I've already got this image.

<h2>Using Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
<div class="aside preview">On this page, you'll learn about:
<ul>
<li>Cascading Style Sheets</li>
<li>How to set the alignment of text</li>
</ul>
<a href="#" target="source">Download the source files</a>
</div>
<p>You now have the <span class="keyword">content</span> that you need to play the game of Nim, but the matches are not yet laid out neatly in a symmetrical V shape. The easiest way to get the images to appear in a V shape is to treat them like text (yes, text) and use <code>center</code> alignment for them. But first, you need to create a separate file to contain the layout instructions.</p>
<p>In your text editor, create a new, empty file called <code>style.css</code>, and save it an a folder called <code>css</code> in same folder as your <code>index.html</code> file. Your folder structure should now look like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="style-css.png" alt="Your nim folder with index.html and folders for img/match.png and css/style.css" />
<figcaption>Figure 36. "Your <code>nim</code> folder with <code>index.html</code> and folders for <code>img/match.png</code> and <code>css/style.css</code></figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Linking the CSS file to your HTML file</h3>
<p>You now need to do two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell the <code>index.html</code> file where to find the <code>style.css</code> file</li>
<li>Tell the <code>style.css</code> file how to treat the HTML elements</li>
</ul>
<p>At the beginning of your <code>index.html</code> file, inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag, add the line that appears in bold below:</p>
<pre>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Nim&lt;/title&gt;
    <span class="new">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css" /&gt;</span>
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
...
</pre>
<p>This tells the browser: "Ask the server for the file <code>style.css</code>, which is in the folder named <code>css/</code>, which is in the same folder as this <code>index.html</code> file that I'm reading now."</p>
<h3>Applying a CSS rule</h3>
<p>In the <code>style.css</code> file, add the following text:</p>
<pre>body {
  text-align: center;
}</pre>
<p>This tells the browser: "For the <code>body</code> element and all its children, make text appear centred on the page."</p>

<h4>What HTML does</h4>
<p>HTML defines the <span class="keyword">content</span> and the <span class="keyword">structure</span> of your web page. In particular, it defines:</p>
<ul>
<li>The text and the images that the visitor will see</li>
<li>How the content is divided into blocks</li>
<li>The role of each block.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some common roles for blocks of content, and the tags that indicate each role:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>Header<code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code> </li>
<li><code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>Sub header<code>&lt;/h2&gt;</code> </li>
<li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code>Paragraph<code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> </li>
<li><code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>Unordered list (like this list)<code>&lt;/ul&gt;</code> </li>
<li><code>&lt;li&gt;</code>Item in a list (like this bullet item)<code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> </li>
<li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code>Generic division<code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> </li>
<li><code>&lt;button&gt;</code>Button<code>&lt;/button&gt;</code> </li>
</ul>
<h4>Parents, children and siblings</h4>
<p>HTML elements can be arranged in a hierarchy. The metaphor of a family is used to describe the hierarchy. A <code>parent</code> element can have one or more <code>child</code> elements, which may have children of their own. Each element, except the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element itself, will have exactly one parent. Elements that have the same parent are called <span class="keyword">siblings</span>. Child elements can inherit certain properties from their parents.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>img</code> elements in the snippet below are children of the <code>div</code> element. The "match 1 row 3" sibling element is the <code>first-child</code>, and the "match 3 row 3" element is the <code>last-child</code>.</p>
<pre>    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 1 row 3" /&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 2 row 3" /&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 3 row 3" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p class="aside note">In the current version of CSS (CSS3) child elements cannot affect their parents, and younger siblings (which appear lower down the HTML page) cannot affect their older siblings.</p>
<h4><code>class</code>es and other attributes</h4>
<p>HTML elements may have <span class="keyword">attributes</span>, which are defined inside the opening tag. One important attribute that you can use with any element is <code>class</code>. An HTML element can have more than one class, and many elements can share the same class. You can use classes to tell the browser what CSS <span class="keyword">rules</span> to apply to each element.</p>
<p>Other common attributes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>background-color</code></li>
<li><code>color</code> (the colour of the text)</li>
<li><code>font-size</code></li>
<li><code>width</code></li>
<li><code>height</code></li>
</ul>
<h4>CSS rules</h4>
<p>CSS rules are defined like this:</p>
<pre><span class="keyword">selector</span> {
<span class="keyword">attribute</span>: <span class="keyword">value</span>;
<span class="keyword">attribute</span>: <span class="keyword">value</span>;
}</pre>
<div class="aside info">White space is not important in CSS rules, and the final semi-colon is not essential. The rule above could also be defined as:
<pre><span class="keyword">selector</span> {<span class="keyword">attribute</span>:<span class="keyword">value</span>; <span class="keyword">attribute</span>:<span class="keyword">value</span>}</pre>
</div>
<p>A <span class="keyword">selector</span> can be defined in many ways. Here are some that you will be seeing soon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Official tag names, such as <code>body</code></li>
<li>Class names, such as <code>.matches</code></li>
<li>A combination of tags and classes, such as <code>div.matches img</code>. The order of the selector items, and the gaps (or lack of gaps) between them defines a hierarchy of HTML elements. The browser reads the list from right to left. This example will select all <code>img</code> elements which have a <code>div</code> with the class <code>matches</code> as a parent.</li>
<li><span class="keyword">Pseudo-elements</span>, such as <code>:hover</code>, which apply to an element only in certain circumstances. For instance, <code>:hover</code> is only applied if the mouse cursor is hovering over the element.</li>
</ul>
<p>The selector defines which element(s) the rule will apply to. There can be more than one rule that selects a given element. As you will see, there are precise rules about the order in which the rules are applied: precise selectors have priority over more general selectors, and rules that are defined later take priority of rules that were defined earlier.</p>
<p>An <span class="keyword">attribute</span> is the official name of something that you can change about an HTML element. Different attributes have a different range of <span class="keyword">values</span>. You can find details of each type of element, its attributes, and their possible values on <a href="">the w3schools site.</a>.</p>

<h2>CSS selectors and classes</h2>
<div class="aside preview">On this page, you'll learn about the <span class="keyword">class</span> attribute for HTML elements:
<p>In particular, you will learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select an element by its tag name</li>

<li>Select an element by its class</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>As it happens, you won't want to centre all the text in your game. For example, later, you will want the text for the rules to be aligned to the left. Using a CSS <span class="keyword">selector</span>, you can choose to apply <code>text-align: center</code> only to the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements that show the matches.</p>
<p>In your <code>styles.css</code> file, rename the selector from <code>body</code> to <code>div</code>, as shown below:</p>
<pre class="revised"><span class="new">div</span> {
  text-align: center;
}</pre>
<p>If you save your file and refresh it in the browser, you should see no change. To check that something has changed, you can add a header to your <code>index.html</code> page:</p>
<pre class="revised">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Nim&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    <span class="new">&lt;h1&gt;Nim&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;The game that will beat you&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 1 row 1" /&gt;
...</pre>
<p>As you can see in the screenshot below, only the matches inside the <code>div</code> elements are centred. The text is aligned to the left.</p>
<figure>
<img src="div-centered.png" alt="Applying the text-align rule to all div elements" />
<figcaption>Figure 38. Applying the <code>text-align</code> rule to all <code>div</code> elements</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Classes</h3>
<p>But later, you will be creating more <code>div</code> elements, and they will not contain matches. How can you select just some elements and not others? The answer is to use a <span class="keyword">class</span>.</p>
<p>For the first <code>div</code> element, the one containing 7 matches, add a class attribute called <code>matches</code>, as shown below:</p>
<pre class="revised">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Nim&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Nim&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;The game that will beat you&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div <span class="new">class="matches"&gt;</span>
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 1 row 1" /&gt;
...</pre>
<p>In your <code>styles.css</code> file, make the rule more specific:</p>
<pre class="revised"><span class="new">div.matches</span> {
  text-align: center;
}</pre>
<p>The rule now applies only to the <code>div</code> that has a class containing the word "matches". The other <code>div</code>s are not affected.</p>
<figure>
<img src="align-matches.png" alt="Using div.matches as a selector limits the selection" />
<figcaption>Figure 39. Using <code>div.matches</code> as a selector limits the selection</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To ensure that all the matches appear centred, you can add <code>class="matches"</code> to all 4 <code>div</code>s, save your <code>index.html</code> page, and refresh your browser to check.</p>
<h3>Simplifying the selector</h3>
<p>In this particular case, the only HTML elements which will have a <code>matches</code> class will be these 4 <code>div</code>s. The browser reads CSS rules from right to left, so <code>.matches</code> is sufficient as a selector.</p>
<pre class="revised"><span class="new">.matches</span> {
  text-align: center;
}</pre>
<div class="aside info">A dot <code>.</code> before a selector item indicates a <span class="keyword">class name</span>. A selector item without a dot designates a <span class="keyword">tag name</span>.
<p>You will also see selector items that start with a hash <code>#</code> character. These are <code>id</code>s. The browser will only recognize one element with a given <code>id</code> on a given page. You can use <code>id="<span class="keyword">unique-id-name"</span> </code> to identify unique elements, such as a checkbox or radio button. You will be doing this on page <a href="#rules">29: Showing the rules</a>.</p></div>
<div class="aside git">Remember to use the Terminal to push these changes to the GitHub server. Here's a shorter version, without the <code>git status</code> command. The <code>-a</code> option for <code>commit</code> will automatically apply the <code>add</code> command for all changed files. Since you only have one repository, and one branch checked out, Git will automatically know that you are referring to the <code>origin</code> local repository and the <code>gh-pages</code> branch, so you can omit this information, too.

<p>One important question is: "How big should the game be?" And one good answer is: "I don't know yet. Let's deal with the proportions first and work out the size later." So that's the way I propose that you should work.</p>
<p class="aside tip">For purely practical reasons, since this is a tutorial, it will be good to make the game tall and thin.

<p class="aside note">Note that if you push changes to the remote repository on GitHub now, you will not see your changes on your GitHub web site, because your site is linked to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch. The <code>rollover</code> branch is intended only for testing locally.</p>
<p>Now you have a new branch: for now it is identical to your <code>gh-pages</code> branch, complete with the changes that you have just committed. However, you want to take a step back to the previous state, and then work forward from there. You can do this with the <code>git revert &lt;commit-name&gt;</code> command. First you need to know the name of your last commit. You can find this using <code>git log</code>. If you use the <code>--oneline</code> option.

<p>You can now use the commands <code>git checkout gh-pages</code> and <code>git checkout rollover</code> to switch between your two branches. If you refresh your browser after each <code>checkout</code> command, you will see the different states. The text in your <code>style.css</code> file should update too, inside your text editor.</p>

<h3>px, em and %: three units of measurement</h3>
<p>There are 7 different units of measurement in CSS. The three that are most often used are <code>px</code>, <code>em</code> and <code>%</code>. (The other four units are percentages of the size of the browser window. You can achieve neat effects with them, but you won't use them in this tutorial. See the Learn More about CSS units below to discover how they work.)</p>
<p><code>px</code> stands for "pixel" (or <em>pict</em>ure <em>el</em>ement). I'm guessing that you know that a pixel is the smallest dot that can be shown on your computer monitor. I imagine that you are familiar with setting the size of a font, or checking the dimensions of an image or a computer screen using pixels.When you use <code>px</code> to measure an element in CSS, it will always be the fixed size that you set.</p>
<p>You can use it now to make the text in your <code>index.html</code> page smaller. In your <code>style.css</code> file, add the following rule:</p>
<pre class="revised"><span class="new">body {
  font-size: 10px;
}</span>

.matches {
  text-align: center;
}</pre>
<p>Save your changes and refresh your <code>index.html</code> page in your browser. You should see that the characters have become smaller. But they are not as small as 10 pixels. You can ask your browser to explain why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click on the word "Nim"</li>
<li>Choose Inspect Element from the contextual menu that opens</li>
</ul>
<p class="aside note">If you don't see an Inspect Element in the contextual menu, see the Troubleshooting section below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="inspect-element" alt="Using the elements inspector" />
<figcaption>Figure 42. Using the Elements Inspector</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the Styles pane on the right of the Elements Inspector, you should see that the <span class="keyword">user agent stylesheet</span> has a rule for <code>h1</code> elements that gives them a font-size of <code>2em</code>.</p>
 <div class="aside info">The user agent stylesheet
<p>If you provide no CSS information about your web page, the browser will use default values. Different browsers have different default values. In Google Chrome, the default value for font-size is 16px. <span class="keyword">User agent</span> is a technical word for "browser".</p>
</div>
<p>But what's an <span class="keyword">em</span>?</p>
<h3>em: the font ratio unit</h3>
<p>In the Elements Inspector, if you click on the Computed tab of the right-hand pane, and scroll down if necessary, you will see that the computed font-size is 20px. The font-size for the body is 10px, the font-size for the <code>h1</code> element is 2em, and its computed font-size is 20px = 2 x 10px. If you were to guess that <span class="keyword">em</span> is a number to multiply font-sizes by, you'd be right.</p>
<p>In the world of print, an <span class="keyword">em</span> is the width of the letter M in a given font face. It is used as a unit of spacing. In the world of the web, an <span class="keyword">em</span> is a similar unit of spacing, but it refers to the <em>height</em> of the font, from the top of the tallest character to the bottom of the lowest character.</p>
<p>The <code>font-size</code> attribute is inherited. This means that when you (or the user agent) sets it for the <code>body</code> element, all the other elements in your page will inherit the same value, even your images. The <code>match.png</code> image is exactly 10 times as tall as it is wide. If you set its width to <code>1em</code> and its height to <code>10em</code> then it will appear 10px wide and 100px tall. If you now change the <code>font-size</code> of the body element to <code>16px</code>, it will become 16px wide and 160px tall. In other words: you can use the <code>font-size</code> to scale your images.</p>
<p>Try it. In your <code>style.css</code> file, make the following changes:</p>
<pre class="revised">
body {
  font-size: 10px;
}

.matches {
  text-align: center;
}
<span class="new">.matches img{
  width: 1em;
  height: 10em;
}</span></pre><
<p>Save your <code>style.css</code> file and refresh your <code>index.html</code> file in the browser. You should see the matches become smaller.</p>
<div class="aside note">Note that the selector <code>.matches img</code> means "all <code>img</code> elements which have a parent with the class <code>match</code>. The space between <code>.matches</code> and <code>img</code> means "anywhere in the hierarchy": the element with the <code>match</code> class does not have to be the immediate parent of the <code>img</code> element.
<p>In this case, the selector <code>.matches &gt; img</code> would also work. The <code>&gt;</code> means that the two elements must be in a direct parent-child relationship.</p></div>   
<h3>Using the Elements Inspector to experiment with CSS</h3>
<p>Instead of changing the value of <code>font-size</code> in your <code>style.css</code> file, saving it, and refreshing your browser, you can use a much faster technique for experimenting with CSS, using the browser's Elements Inspector. Right-click on a match and select Inspect Element from the contextual menu that opens. By default, the Styles pane on the right should be open, and you should see a list of the rules that apply to the element that you clicked on.</p>
<p>The third rule in the list as the one that you applied to the <code>body</code> element, to define the font size. If you click on the value (<code>10px</code>) the value should pop out of the pane and the text should be selected. You can now type any value you like (even invalid ones). Alternatively, you can use the Up and Down arrow keys to alter the value by 1 unit. You can hold down the Shift key to alter the value by 10 each time, or the Alt key to alter the value by 0.1.</p>
<figure>
<img src="edit-css-in-element-inspector.png" alt="You can edit CSS in the Elements Inspector" />
<figcaption>Figure 43. You can edit CSS in the Elements Inspector</figcaption>
</figure>
<div class="aside tip">You can edit the CSS of any page quite radically using this technique. You can add new attribute/value pairs, and you can disable existing settings. When you are satisfied with the results, you can copy all or part of a rule and paste it into your CSS file, for later use. <p>Note that when you refresh the page, all these temporary changes to the CSS will be lost.</p></div>

<h3>A % of the parent</h3>
<p>The <code>%</code> unit sets the size of an element as a percentage of the size of its parent. You'll be using this on page <a href="#TODO">XX: Whatever</a>, when you will be arranging the game controls. If you want to know more now, you can read the Learn More About Units section below.</p>

<div class="aside git">You might like to use the following commands in your Terminal to save these changes to your local Git repository. If you are working on the <span class="keyword">rollover</span> branch, you don't have to push the changes to the GitHub server unless you want to access them from a different computer.

<div class="optional details">
<input type="checkbox" id="units-details"/>
<label for="units-details">Learn More About Units</label>
<div>
<p>There are 7 different ways of measuring size in CSS. In this game you are going to use the first 2 of them. Here is the complete list:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>px</code> </dt>
<dd><code>px</code> stands for "pixel". As with all CSS units, there must be no space between the digits and the units. For example, the browser will ignore a rule that is written like this:<pre>
body { font-size: <span class="red">10 px</span> }</pre></dd>
<dt><code>em</code></dt>
<dd>One <code>em</code> is identical to the font-size of the current element. It can therefore have different values in different elements. For example, if the default font-size for the body is 10px and an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> header has a font-size of 2em, the header font will have a size of 2 x 10px = 20px. Padding of 2em around the header text will be 40px thick: 2 x 2 x 10px.
<figure>
<img src="em.png" alt="The value of an em unit depends on the font size of the base element" />
<figcaption>Figure 44. The value of an <code>em</code> unit depends on the font size of the base element</figcaption>
</figure>
</dd>
<dt><code>%</code></dt>
<dd>A percentage width or height is calculated with respect to the width or height of the parent element. If the parent is 100px by 100px and the element has a width of 200% and a height of 50%, it will be 200px by 50px.
<p class="aside note">There is one exception: padding and margin are always calculated with respect to the <em>width</em> of the parent. This means that you can create an element with a fixed aspect ratio by setting its <code>width</code> to 100% of its parent width, its <code>height</code> to 0 and its <code>padding-top</code> to a percentage of its parent width:</p>
<figure>
<img src="percent" alt="Expressing dimensions as a percentage of the parent's dimensions" />
<figcaption>Figure 45. Expressing dimensions as a percentage of the parent's dimensions</figcaption>
</figure>
</dd>
<dt><code>vw</code></dt>
<dd>One <code>vw</code> unit is 1% of the <strong>v</strong>iewport <strong>w</strong>idth: 100 <code>vw</code> units fill the width of the window.</dd>
<dt><code>vh</code></dt>
<dd>One <code>vh</code> unit is 1% of the <strong>v</strong>iewport <strong>h</strong>eight: 100 <code>vw</code> units fill the height of the window.</dd>
<dt><code>vmin</code></dt>
<dd>One <code>vmin</code> unit is the smaller of the <code>vw</code> and the <code>vh</code> units</dd>
<dt><code>vmax</code></dt>
<dd>One <code>vmax</code> unit is the larger of the <code>vw</code> and the <code>vh</code> units</dd> 
</dl>
<p>Elements with sizes measured in <code>px</code> will have a fixed size. Elements with sizes measured in <code>vw</code>, <code>vh</code>, <code>vmin</code> or <code>vmax</code> will change in size when the user resizes the window. Elements with sizes measured in <code>%</code> will have a size relative to their parent: if the size of the parent is measured with respect to the window (as a <code>%</code>, or as a <code>v...</code>), then the size of the element will change with the size of the window. Elements with sizes measured in <code>em</code> will all change in size together if you change the font-size of their base elements.</p>
<div class="aside info">The <code>em</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>vw</code>, <code>vh</code>, <code>vmin</code> and <code>vmax</code> units are for your convenience. In practice, the browser converts these to pixel dimensions before applying them to the elements in your page. If you look at the values shown in the Computed pane of the Elements Inspector, or at the callouts in the main browser window, you will see that the units that are displayed are always <code>px</code>.

<p>In the Elements Inspector, you may have already noticed a diagram that looks like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="box-model" alt="The box model diagram" />
<figcaption>Figure 48. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You may also have noticed that as you move your cursor over the HTML representation of the page elements in the Elements Inspector, coloured highlighting appears in the main browser window, along with a callout of the element type and its dimensions.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Figure 49. Using the Elements Inspector to highlight the dimensions of an element in the browser page</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is a representation of the <span class="keyword">box model</span>. Every visible HTML element is drawn in a rectangular box, with layers like a rectangular onion. The innermost layer is the HTML content itself, such as a piece of text or an image. Around that are three additional layers, which are often invisible:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>padding</code></dt>
  <dd>Padding extends the clickable area of an element. If the element has a <code>background-color</code> this color will extend to the edge of the padding. You can have different amounts of padding one each of the four sides of the element, if you want.</dd>
  <dt><code>border</code></dt>
  <dd>The border also extends the clickable area of an element, by drawing a line around the padding area. The line can be a solid line, or dashed or dotted, a groove or a ridge, inset or outset, or hidden. It can be a different width, style and color on each of the 4 sides, if that is what you choose. You can also give the border (and thus the padding area) rounded corners, and each corner can have a different radius.</dd>
  <dt><code>margin</code></dt>
  <dd>The margin of an element defines the minimum amount of blank between the outside of its border/padding and the next element.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here's a demonstration. Right click on one of the shapes in the sandbox below and select Inspect Element, then edit the values for the different attributes in the Styles pane.</p>

<h3>Edges and shortcuts</h3>
<p>If you look at the CSS for the red element, you will see that it includes the following rules:</p>
<pre>  padding-top: 10px;
  padding-right: 20px;
  padding-bottom: 40px;
  padding-left: 50px;</pre>
<p>However, for the green element, the padding is defined in one line:</p>
<pre>  padding: 6em 7em 4em 3em;</pre>
<p>The rule for green uses a shortcut, with 4 values given at once. The values are defined clockwise, starting at the top (at 12 o'clock). The one-line rule for green is the equivalent of:</p>
<pre>  padding-top: 6em;
  padding-right: 7em;
  padding-bottom: 4em;
  padding-left: 3em;</pre>
<p>When you use the one-line shortcut, you do not need to define all the edges. Here are 3 different one-line shortcuts, and their equivalent in the verbose format:</p>
<pre>  padding: 6em <span class="blue">7em</span> 4em;
  /* This is the same as: */
  padding-top: 6em;
  padding<span class="blue">-right: 7em</span>;
  padding-bottom: 4em;
  padding<span class="blue">-left: 7em</span>;</pre>
<pre>  padding: <span class="red">6em</span> <span class="blue">7em</span>;
  /* This is the same as: */
  padding<span class="red">-top: 6em;</span>
  padding<span class="blue">-right: 7em</span>;
  padding<span class="red">-bottom: 6em</span>;
  padding<span class="blue">-left: 7em</span>;</pre>
<pre>  padding: <span class="red">6em</span>;
  /* This is the same as: */
  padding<span class="red">-top: 6em</span>;
  padding<span class="red">-right: 6em</span>;
  padding<span class="red">-bottom: 6em</span>;
  padding<span class="red">-left: 6em</span>;</pre>
<p>In these examples, I've used the same unit for every edge, but you can use different units for each edge, if that makes sense in your project. For example, this is perfectly valid:</p>
<pre>margin: 0 1px 2em 3%</pre>
<p>When you set a value to <code>0</code>, there is no need to include any unit. The value will be zero regardless of the unit you use.</p>
<div class="aside note">If you use <code>%</code> as the unit for <code>padding</code> or <code>margin</code> then this always refers to the <em>width</em> of the parent, never the height, even when you use it with the <code>-top</code> or <code>-bottom</code> attributes.<p>You cannot use <code>%</code> as the unit for <code>border-width</code>.</p></div>
<h3>The various <code>border</code> attributes</h3>
<p>If you look at the CSS rule for the blue element, you will see that it includes this definition for the border:</p>
<pre>  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 15px 5px;
  border-color: lightblue;
  border-radius: 16px;</pre>
<p>However the <code>border</code> rule for the green is a one-line shortcut:</p>
<pre>  border: dotted 10px palegreen;</pre>
<p>This is equivalent to:</p>
<pre>  border-style: dotted;
  border-width: 10px;
  border-color: palegreen;</pre>
<p>Because all the attributes have different ranges (units, line style names, colors), you can write them in any order you want. This would give exactly the same result:</p>
<pre>  border: 10px dotted palegreen;</pre>
<p>You can leave out the <code>-color</code> and <code>-style</code> attributes. Your browser will provide default values (black and 3.333px, in Google Chrome). You must give a valid value for <code>-style</code>. If you don't the browser will ignore your rule.</p>
<div class="aside note">CSS applies rules in the order in which they appear. For the green element, the colour <code>palegreen</code> is applied to all the edges, thanks to the first rule:<code>border: dotted 10px palegreen;</code>. The next two lines override this choice of <code>border-color</code> for the top and the bottom:
<pre>  border-top-color: darkgreen;
  border-bottom-color: rgba(192, 255, 192, 0.5);</pre>
<p>You can see different ways of defining color on page <a href="#color">16: CSS colors</a>.</p></div>
<h3><code>border-radius</code></h3>
<p>The <code>border-radius</code> attribute is not included in the one-line shortcut. If you want to give rounded corners to your element, you must provide a rule for <code>border-radius</code> separately.</p>
<p>As with the <code>padding</code>, <code>border-width</code> and <code>margin</code> attributes, you can provide a different value for each corner, in a single line. This rule for the blue element...</p>
<pre>  border-radius: 16px 0 2em;</pre>
<p>... is equivalent to:</p>
<pre>  border-top-left-radius: 16px;
  border-top-right-radius: 0px;
  border-bottom-right-radius: 2em;
  border-bottom-left-radius: 0px;</pre>
<p class="aside note">If you make the <code>border-radius</code> bigger than the dimensions of the element, it will automatically be reduced to the largest meaningful value. The green element initially has a <code>border-radius</code> of 100em, or 2000px, but the radius that is actually applied is only 110px.</p>
<p class="aside tip">Explore what happens when you change the <code>font-size</code> attribute of the <code>parent</code> element. You'll see how the values with <code>em</code> units change size while the values with <code>px</code> </p>
<h3>Using what you have learnt</h3>
<p>When you have done enough experimenting to feel comfortable with the different layers of the box model, you can apply your new understanding to your own project. In your <code>style.css</code> file, make the following change:</p>
<pre class="revised">body {
  font-size: 10px;
}

.matches {
  text-align: center;
}
.matches img{
  width: 1em;
  height: 10em;
  <span class="new">padding: 1em;
  background-color: gray;
  border-radius: 1.5em;</span>
}</pre>
<p>Save your file and refresh the page in your browser window. You should see something similar to this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="padding-background" alt="Creating padding with a background-color" />
<figcaption>Figure 51. Creating <code>padding</code> with a <code>background-color</code> around the match images</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The matches have been pushed apart by the padding that you have created around them.</p>
<div class="aside note">Now you can see that there is a gap between each match. This is a space <code> </code> character. By default, HTML displays any series of <span class="keyword">whitespace</span> characters as a single space <code>&nbsp;</code>. Whitespace characters include:
<ul>
<li>spaces</li>
<li>tabulation characters (tabs) <code></code> </li>
<li>carriage returns (used to separate paragraphs on Macintosh computers)</li>
<li>line feed characters (used to separate paragraphs on Unix-like computers)</li>
<li>the combination of a carriage return and a line feed character  (used to separate paragraphs on Windows computers)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wanted to get rid of the spaces between the matches, you could edit your HTML so that there is no whitespace between the end of one <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and the beginning of the next:</p>
<pre class="revised">...
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 1 row 1"
    <span class="new">/&gt;&lt;</span>img src="img/match.png" alt="match 2 row 1"
    <span class="new">/&gt;&lt;</span>img src="img/match.png" alt="match 3 row 1"
    <span class="new">/&gt;&lt;</span>img src="img/match.png" alt="match 4 row 1"
    <span class="new">/&gt;&lt;</span>img src="img/match.png" alt="match 5 row 1"
    <span class="new">/&gt;&lt;</span>img src="img/match.png" alt="match 6 row 1"
    <span class="new">/&gt;&lt;</span>img src="img/match.png" alt="match 7 row 1" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
...
</pre>
<p>You'll notice that the browser doesn't care what whitespace characters you use inside a tag, or how many you use. If you like to write each attribute on a different line, arranged neatly in columns, the browser will be just as happy:</p>
<pre>    &lt;img src="img/match.png"
         alt="match 1 row 1"
    /&gt;</pre>

  <p>You can use your own preferred English spellings: both <code>grey</code> and <code>gray</code> refer to the same colo(u)r.</p>

  <dt><code>rgb</code>: Red, Green, Blue</dt>
  <dd><p>Most humans have three types of light detector cells in their eyes. These react most strongly to the <span class="keyword">primary colours</span> that we call red, green and blue.</p><p>To create colours that look realistic to us humans, a computer screen generate dots that emit varying levels of red, green or blue light.</p>
  <p>Computers count in 0s and 1s. With one <span class="keyword">bit</span> or <em>bi</em>nary dig<em>it</em>, you can create 2 values: 0 or 1. As a result, computers work fastest with numbers that are powers of 2, like 2, 4, 8, 16, ... 256. 256 is a nice number because it is can be represented by 8 bits, and 8 is a power of 2. With 8 bits, you can represent numbers from 0 (<code>00000000</code>) to 255 (<code>11111111</code> or 1x128 + 1x64 + 1x32 + 1x16 + 1x16 + 1x8 + 1x4 + 1x2 + 1x1).</p>
  <p>In good light, the human eye can distinguish millions of distinct colours. Computer screens can generate millions of distinct colours by varying the amount of red, green and blue light over 256 different values: from 0 to 255. A <code>color</code> that is made of 255 units of red plus 127 units of green and 0 units of blue will appear <span class="orange">orange</span>. Using the same amount of all three primary colours will give various shades of grey, from "black" (0 of all three colours) to "white" (255 for all three colours). In fact, you do not get pure black: you get the dark grey colour of your unlit screen. You do not get pure white either: you get a pale grey that doesn't hurt your eyes too much.</p>
  <p>When you want to tell a computer which colour to display, you can use the format <code>rgb(<span class="keyword">red-value</span>, <span class="keyword">green-value</span>, <span class="keyword">blue-value</span>)</code>. For example: this colour of <span class="orange">orange</span> can be expressed as <code>rgb(255, 127, 0)</code>.</p>

  </dd>
  <dt><code>rgba</code>: Red, Green, Blue and Alpha</dt>
  <dd><p>Colours defined in the <code>rgb()</code> format are solid, opaque colours. To make a colour appear transparent, so that it is affected by other colours behind it, you can add a 4th variable: <span class="keyword">alpha</span> opacity. For CSS, this is expressed as a number between <code>0.0</code> and <code>1.0</code>, where <code>0.0</code> means "no opacity at all" (or "completely transparent"), and <code>1.0</code> means "totally opaque".</p>
  <p>Here are two elements that overlap. The one on the left has a rule <code>background-color: rgb(255,0,0)</code> (opaque red). The one on the right <code>background-color: rgb<strong>a</strong>(0,255,0,<strong>0.5</strong>)</code> (semi-transparent blue). Where they overlap, the <code>color</code> becomes <code>rgb(127, 0, 127)</code>: half of each original <code>color</code>.</p>
  <div class="rgb red"></div><div class="rgb blue"></div>

  <dt>Hexadecimal</dt>
  <dd>The computer doesn't really understand colours and decimal numbers. It prefers binary, but binary numbers are long to write. Here's the number 42 in binary: <code>00101010</code>. A compromise is to use a hexadecimal system, where you count in powers of 16. The number 42 can be written as 2x16 + 10x1, or <code>2A</code>, where <code>A</code> stands for 10.</p>
  <p>In a number system that counts in 16s, you need a separate symbol for every value from 0 - 15. Our decimal system has numbers from 0 - 9; for the numbers 11 - 15, the letters A - F are used.</p>
  <p>To make it clear that the string <code>#FF7F00</code> is a number, a <code>#</code> hash sign is placed at the beginning. Here's how you can understand this number:</p>
  <br /><span class="red">FF</span><span class="green">7F</span><span class="blue">00</span>
  <br /><span class="red">Fx16 + Fx1 red</span>, <span class="green">7x16 + Fx1 green</span>, <span class="blue">0x16 + 0x1 blue</span>
  <br /><span class="red">15x16 + 15x1 = 255 red</span>, <span class="green">7x16 + 15x1 = 127 green</span>, <span class="blue">0x16 + 0x1 = 0 blue</span>
  <br />rgb(<span class="red">255</span>, <span class="green">127</span>, <span class="blue">0</span>)
  <br />You've seen this colour before. It's <span class="orange">orange</span>.
  <p>From now on, any time you see a string of 6 characters chosen from the set <code>0123456789ABCDEF</code>, you'll know that this can be used to represent a colour, in the way that computers like best.</p>

  <dt>Short hexadecimal: multiples of 17</dt>
  <dd><p></p>In the early days of the Internet, connections were slow, and every bit was a burden. That's why you see element names like <code>p</code> and <code>img</code>, and units like <code>px</code>, instead of whole words.</p>
  <p>It's possible to express 4,096 distinct colours using only 4 characters instead of 7. For CSS, the number <code>#F70</code> is a short form for <code>#FF7700</code>. This is not exactly the same orange as <code>#FF7F00</code>, but it is so close you are unlikely to notice the difference.</p>

  <dt><code>hsl</code>: Hue, Saturation, Luminosity</dt>
  <dd><p>Humans don't think of colours as numbers. It's difficult to compare several colour numbers and know whether they will make a matching set.</p>
  <p>Humans (at least English-speaking ones) tend to think of three aspects of colour. The technical terms for these are <span class="keyword">hue</span>, <span class="keyword">saturation</span> and <span class="keyword">luminosity</span>, but you might prefer to think of <span class="keyword">colour</span>, <span class="keyword">clarity</span> and <span class="keyword">darkness</span>.</p>
  <p><span class="keyword">Hue</span> refers to the basic colours of the rainbow, cycling through <span class="red">red</span>, <span class="orange">orange</span>, <span class="yellow">yellow</span>, <span class="green">green</span>, <span class="cyan">cyan</span>, <span class="blue">blue</span>, <span class="magenta">magenta</span> and back to <span class="red">red</span> again.</p>
  <p><span class="keyword">Saturation</span> means how much white has been added. The more white you add to a colour, the more "washed out" it looks. Saturated colours grab your attention. Unsaturated colours are restful pastel shades.</p>
  <p><span class="keyword">Luminosity</span> refers to how much light you can see. As you add more black to a colour, so its luminosity decreases.</p>
  <p>You can think of colour space as being cylindrical. Imagine a  or disc with all the bright, saturated colours around the edge. There are 360° in a circle. You can think of <span class="red">red</span>as being at 0°, <span class="green">green</span> at 120° and <span class="blue">blue</span> at 240°. The colour <span class="magenta">,magenta</span>, halfway between blue and red will be at 300°.</p>
  <p>You can imagine that as you move towards the centre of the disc, at the point where all the colours add together to become white light. And you can imagine many discs piled on top of each other, with top one being full of light and the bottom one being in total darkness. Every point on the disc at the bottom will be black.</p>
  <figure>
  <img src="color-wheel" alt="A colour wheel with saturated colours on the circumference and white in the middle." />
  <figcaption>Figure 59. A colour wheel with saturated colours on the circumference and white in the middle.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The <span class="keyword">hsl</span> format describes colours in terms of:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Hue: a rotation around the circle, from 0° up to (but not including) 360°</li>
  <li>Saturation: a value of clarity from 0% (a shade of grey) to 100% (a pure colour)</li>
  <li>Luminosity: a value of brightness from 0% (totally black) to 100% (bright)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Google Chrome colorpicker shows the colour space as a series of knife cuts through a cylindrical cake: white at the top left, at the point where the knife will start cutting from the centre of the cake; saturated colours at the top right, at the outside edge of the cake; and black at the bottom. The vertical strip on the right represents a ribbon around the circumference of the cake, showing the colours at the top circular edge.</p>
  <figure>
  <img src="color-hsl" alt="The colorpicker displays colours in terms of hue, saturation and luminosty" />
  <figcaption>Figure 59. The colorpicker displays colours in terms of hue, saturation and luminosty</figcaption>
  </figure>
  </dd>
  <dt><code>hsla</code>: Hue, Saturation, Luminosity and Alpha</dt>
  <dd>As with the RGB format, you can add an alpha value between <code>0.0</code> and <code>1.0</code> to set the opacity of a colour defined with hue, saturation and luminosity.
  <figure>
  <img src="color-" alt="Use the alpha slider to set the opacity of the colour." />
  <figcaption>Figure 60. Use the alpha slider to set the opacity of the colour.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p class="aside note">Luminosity changes diagonally, from the bottom right to the top left. At the top and the right edge of the colour slice, saturation is considered to be 100%. At the top right hand corner, saturation is at 50%: there is neither extra darkness nor extra light.</p>
<div class="aside tip">You might find the Hue, Saturation Luminosity method of describing colours the easiest to visualize.
<ul>
<li>To create a page with co-ordinated colours, you can pick one value for hue, and vary the values for saturation and luminosity.</li><li>To create a page with bright, vibrant colours, you can set saturation to 100 and luminosity to 50, and vary the hue.</li>
<li>To create a page in pastel colours, choose a fairly low value for saturation (such as 25) and a fairly high value for luminosity (such as 75), and vary the hue.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="aside tip">You can use the colorpicker in the Elements Inspector to pick a colour, and then copy its definition and paste it into your <code>CSS</code> file.</p>
<h3>Opacity</h3>
<p>You can use the alpha value in the <code>rgba</code> and <code>hsla</code> colour formats to change the opacity of an area of colour. You can also use the <code>opacity</code> attribute to change the opacity of an entire element, such as an image.</p>
<p>To give you a taste of the JavaScript that you will be writing soon, try this in the Developer Tools window:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the Console tab at the bottom of the  Developer Tools window and open it up to give yourself room.</li>
<li>You'll see a <code>&gt;</code> <span class="keyword">prompt</span> symbol at the top of the Console pane. Click just to the right of it and enter the following JavaScript code:
<pre>document.getElementsByTagName("img")</pre>
<p class="aside note">In JavaScript, it's important to get the case of every letter right, so you might prefer to copy and paste the code above.</p></li>
<li>Press the Enter key.</li>
<li>You should see an <span class="keyword">array</span> of all the <code>img</code> elements in your <code>index.html</code> page.</li>
<li>The <code>&gt;</code> <span class="keyword">prompt</span> symbol will now appear beneath the output.</li>
<li>Press the Up arrow, to make the last command that you typed reappar after the prompt.</li>
<li>Add the following text at the end of the command:<pre class="revised">document.getElementsByTagName("img")<span class="new">[0].style.opacity = 0.25</span></pre></li>
<li>Press the Enter key</li>
<li>Look at the main browser window for your <code>index.html</code> page. The first match, and the padding around it, should have become semi-transparent.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Setting the <code>background-color</code> for your page</h3>
<p>Now that you know how to define colors, perhaps you'd like to change the background colour of your page. You can choose whatever colour and use whichever format you prefer to define it. For my version of the game, I have used the simplest way to say "black":</p>
<p>Make the following change to your <code>style.css</code> file, save your changes, then refresh your browser.</p>
<pre class="revised">body {
  font-size: 10px;
  <span class="new">background-color: black;</span>
}

.matches {
  text-align: center;
}
.matches img{
  width: 1em;
  height: 10em;
  padding: 1em;
  background-color: gray;
  border-radius: 1.5em;
}</pre>
<figure>

<figcaption>Figure 62. Setting the <code>background-color</code> of the page</figcaption>

<h3>Text <code>color</code></h3>
<p>Oops. Black text on a black background is just a little bit too Ninja to be readable. You can set the <code>color</code> of all the text in your web page by making the change shown below. You can, of course, use whatever colour you want</p>
<pre class="revised">body {
  font-size: 10px;
  background-color: black;
  <span class="new">color: rgb(255,255,255);</span>
}

.matches {
  text-align: center;
}
.matches img{
  width: 1em;
  height: 10em;
  padding: 1em;
  background-color: gray;
  border-radius: 1.5em;
}</pre>
<figure>
<img src="background-black" alt="Setting the color for all text" />
<figcaption>Figure 63. Setting the <code>color</code> for all text on the page</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are 2 things to notice here.</p>
<ol>
<li>All other <code>-color</code> attributes begin with the name of the part whose colour you want to change: <code>background-color</code>, <code>border-color</code>, <code>border-top-color</code> and so on. For text, there is no <code><span class="red">text-color</span></code> attribute. The attribute name is just plain <code>color</code>.</li>
<li>You are not changing the <code>color</code> of the text in the <code>h1</code> and <code>h2</code> elements directly. You are changing the <code>color</code> of the <code>body</code>, which is the ultimate parent of every other element on the page. The <code>h1</code> and <code>h2</code> elements (and all other elements) <span class="keyword">inherit</span> the value of <code>color</code>, unless you set it directly for a specific element and its children.</li>
</ol>
<div class="aside git">It's time to commit your latest changes to your local repository:

<h2>CSS interactions</h2>
<div class="aside preview">On this page, you'll learn how to:

<li>Change the appearance of the cursor</li>
<li>Change the value of an attribute when the mouse is over an element</li>
</ul>
<a href="#" target="source">Download the source files</a>
</div>
<p>When you move your cursor over a link on a web page, the cursor changes to a pointing finger, and often the link changes colour. You can make this happen when the cursor moves over a match image, too. Changing the cursor image is easy. You can do it with one line of CSS:</p>
<pre class="revised">body {
  font-size: 10px;
  background-color: black;
  color: rgb(255,255,255);
}

.matches {
  text-align: center;
}
.matches img{
  width: 1em;
  height: 10em;
  padding: 1em;
  border-radius: 1.5em;
  background-color: gray;

}</pre>
<figure>

<figcaption>Figure 64. The cursor image changes to a pointer over the match images</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Changing the <code>background-color</code> is as easy as creating a new rule, and moving one line of code. I've also taken the opportunity to choose a new value for the <code>background-color</code>. You can, of course, choose whichever colour you prefer. Remember to delete the line <code>background-color: gray;</code> from the existing <code>.matches img { }</code> rule.</p>

<pre class="revised">body {
  font-size: 10px;
  background-color: black;
  color: rgb(255,255,255);
}

.matches {
  text-align: center;

<!-- MERGING 2 GIT BRANCHES -->
<section id="merge">
<h2>Merging two branches with Git</h2>
<div class="aside preview">On this page, you'll practise using the following Git commands:
<ul>
<li><code>git diff <em>other-branch</em></code></li>
<li><code>git merge <em>other-branch</em></code></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>On page <a href="#mouse">13: Reacting to the mouse</a>, you tested a CSS file before you had had the chance to understand how it worked. Since then, you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Created a separate <em>rollover</em> branch in your repository</li>
<li>Reverted to an earlier version of the project</li>
<li>Added new CSS rules that make your project behave the same way that the preview version did.</li>
</ul>
<p>How close is your current version to the one you tested earlier? To find out, you can run the <code>git diff</code> command in the Terminal.</p>
<div class="aside tip">You might like to start by ensuring that your Terminal is pointing at the <code>nim</code> folder where your project files are stored. Your command might look something like this...
<pre>cd <span class="red">C:\Users\james</span>\nim\gh-pages</pre>
<p>... but your own path will be different from the red section above, and it will use forward slashes <code>/</code> if you are not working on Windows.</p>
</div>
<h2>git diff</h2>
<p>In the Terminal window, run the following command:</p>
<pre>git diff gh-pages</pre>
<p>This will show you all the differences between your current branch (rollever) and the gh-pages branch. If there are no differences, congratulations! You have followed my instructions to the letter! (Or you have skipped most of the last 5 pages, or you haven't been inspired to choose colours of your own).</p>
<p>The chances are, though, that you might see something like this:</p>
<pre>git diff rollover gh-pages
diff --git a/css/style.css b/css/style.css

<p>First, you want to get back onto your main gh-pages branch, then you want to merge the gh-pages branch with your rollover branch. Here's what you can do:</p>
<pre class="revised"><span class="new">git checkout gh-pages</span>
Switched to branch 'gh-pages'

<span class="new">git merge rollover</span>
Updating 8439f0a..32f3995
Fast-forward
 css/style.css | 4 ++--
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)

<span class="new">git diff rollover</span>
</pre>
<p>In my case, the last command produced no output. This is because the rollover branch and the gh-pages branch are now identical.</p>
<h3>Checking your history</h3>
<p>You can also check that the history in the gh-pages branch now includes all the changes you made in the rollover branch, using the <code>git log --oneline</code> command. Here's my output, with the commits made in the rollover branch shown in bold:</p>
<pre>git log --oneline
<span class="new">32f3995 Add cursor: pointer and an img:hover rule
4f37955 Set background-color and color for the entire page
e2b3e69 Add padding, border-radius and background-color
7217eb8 Set body font-size in px and match dimensions in em
3e9c2b9 Revert "Preview of rollover effect"</span>
8439f0a Preview of rollover effect
ad5e390 Add .matches class to designate the divs to be centered
656e9b6 Add css/styles.css to centre the matches
7c1cdc9 16 matches arranged in 4 rows, using &lt;div&gt;
4d68023 Add img/match.png; modified index.html to show this image
b6d433d 'Hello World' becomes 'The game will go here'
e6b50f7 Initial commit to the gh-pages branch
</pre>
<p>Reload your local <code>index.html</code> file in your browser. Roll your mouse over the images. Check that it's all still working.</p>
<h3>Deleting a branch</h3>
<p>Now that your gh-pages branch is up-to-date, you no longer need the rollover branch. You can delete it. In your Terminal window, type the following command:</p>
<pre class="revised"><span class="new">git branch</span>
* <span class="green">gh-pages</span>
  rollover</pre>
<p>In the output, the asterisk shows which branch is currently checked out. You can also use the <code>-v</code> (verbose) option to show the name and message from the most recent <code>commit</code> on each branch, to check that both branches are at the same point:</p>
<pre class="revised"><span class="new">git branch -v</span>
* <span class="green">gh-pages </span><span class="new">32f3995 Add cursor: pointer and an img:hover rule</span>
  rollover 32f3995 Add cursor: pointer and an img:hover rule</pre>
<p>The name of the commit will be different for you.</p>
<p>To delete the rollover branch, you can use the <code>-d</code> (delete) option, followed by the branch name:</p>
<pre class="revised"><span class="new">git branch -d rollover</span>
Deleted branch rollover (was 32f3995).</pre>
<p>If your run the simple <code>branch</code> command again, you should see that your repository tree has been trimmed:</p>
<pre class="revised"><span class="new">git branch</span>
* <span class="green">gh-pages</span></pre>
<h3>Making the most of branches</h3>
<p>You have now seen the whole life cycle of a branch: how to create a new branch, how to use it to make changes without changing the anything in the stable main branch, how to merge it back into the main branch, and how to delete it when you no longer need it.</p>
<p>You can feel comfortable now about using branches. You can create a new branch whenever you start a new episode in your development process. You can create a new branch whenever you want to try out a new idea.</p>

<h2>Hiding Images with JavaScript</h2>
<div class="aside preview">On this page, you'll learn how to:
<ul>
<li>Add JavaScript to your HTML page</li>
<li>Show an alert when the page is loaded</li>
</ul>
<a href="#" target="source">Download the source files</a>
</div>
<p>JavaScript adds magic to your game... or at least the illusion of magic. Each of the ideas that you are about to learn is simple enough in itself. The power of what you are learning comes from the way you can combine these new ideas.</p>
<div class="aside tip">Each time you learn something new, you can create a new branch in your repository and use it to experiment with the new idea. You can imagine a simple activity of your own, and test how far you can take it.
<p>As your skills and knowledge increase, you can return to branches that you worked on earlier, and move them forward again. Perhaps some of your branches can become the starting point for a whole new project.</p></div>
<p>To keep your project tidy, you should store all your JavaScript in a separate folder. In your text editor, create a new document, and save at as <code>nim.js</code> in a folder called <code>js</code>, alongside your <code>index.html</code> file. Your project folder should now look like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="project-folder" alt="The img, css and js folders in the same folder as your index.html file" />
<figcaption>Figure 66. The img, css and js folders in the same folder as your index.html file</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Hello World in JavaScript</h3>
<p>In your <code>nim.js</code> file, add the following code:</p>
<pre>alert("Hello World")</pre>
<p>This is just to test that JavaScript is working for you.</p>
<p>Now you need to tell your <code>index.html</code> file that your new JavaScript file exists. At the end of your <code>index.html</code> file, make the following change:</p>
<pre class="revised">...
    &lt;div class="matches"&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/match.png" alt="match 1 row 4" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    <span class="new">&lt;script src="js/nim.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
<p>Save both files and refresh the <code>index.html</code> page in your browser. If all goes well, you should see something like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="js-hello-world" alt="A Hello World JavaScript alert" />
<figcaption>Figure 67. A Hello World JavaScript alert</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you don't see this alert dialog, then check the Troubleshooting section below.</p>

<div class="optional details">
<input type="checkbox" id="js-details"/>
<label for="js-details">Understanding the script element</label>
<div>
<h4>Why the script element is placed at the bottom of the body</h4>
<p>Browsers read an HTML page from top to bottom. Normally, you want the browser to know about all the content (text and images) before you ask JavaScript to do something with this content. The simplest way to do this is to put your JavaScript declarations at the end of the page, just before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag.</p>
<h4>Why the script element is empty</h4>
<p>You can use a <code>&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> element in two different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>To place JavaScript code inside your HTML page itself, like this:
<pre>&lt;script&gt;alert ("I'm code in the HTML page")&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
</li>
<li>To link to an external file which contains code, like this:
<pre>&lt;script src="http://example.com/test.js" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></li>
</ul>
<p>In this second case, any code you put inside the tag will be ignored, so you might as well leave the tag empty.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Fetching the JavaScript file</h4>
<p>When the browser reads the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, it doesn't know anything about the code in the external file yet. The JavaScript file is stored on a remote server, and the browser needs to send a request to the server to retrieve the file. When the contents of the file have arrived across the Internet, then the browser can start executing your JavaScript code.</p>

<div class="optional tips">
<input type="checkbox" id="js-tips"/>
<label for="js-tips">Tips and Tricks</label>
<div>
<div class="aside info">Semi-colons? Really?
<p>The official way to indicate the end of a command in JavaScript is to use a semi-colon, like this:</p>
<pre>alert ("Hello World!");</pre>
<p>In CSS, semi-colons are essential. If you don't include a semi-colon between rules, your CSS will break.</p>
<p>Fortunately, all modern JavaScript engines have an <span class="keyword">automatic semi-colon insertion system</span>, which works, and which means that you can forget to put semi-colons at the end of your commands... except in certain very specific places.</p>
<p>Semi-colons in JavaScript generate powerful emotions in some developers. For some, they are a sign of purity; for others, a sign of wastefulness.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, I have deliberately chosen not to use semi-colons except where they are absolutely necessary. And when they are absolutely necessary, I put them at the <em>beginning</em> of a line, or in the middle of a line. I have done this for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>So that you can discover where semi-colons are absolutely necessary (and that's important)</li>
<li>So that you can see at a glance which code is JavaScript and which code is CSS (and that's just convenient)</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are working on a project with others, the fact that you use or don't use semi-colons can be one way to distinguish your code immediately from the code of others, with all the shame and glory that that can bring.</p>
</div>
<div class="aside tip">A script-only HTML page
<p>Since your browser will automatically add any missing &lt;html&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; tags to your page, you can create a very simple HTML page just to test some JavaScript code. You might like to copy the HTML below and paste it into a new text document, save the document as <code>test.html</code>, then open it in your browser.</p>
<pre>&lt;script&gt;
alert ("JavaScript says Hello!")
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>Be sure to give the file a <code>.html</code> extension, to trick the browser into treating it as a valid HTML file. If you use a different extension, you will simply see the text displayed in the browser window.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="optional trouble">
<input type="checkbox" id="js-trouble"/>
<label for="js-trouble">Troubleshooting </label>
<div>
<p class="symptom">No Hello World alert appears when you refresh your <code>index.html</code> page.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you open your <code>nim.js</code> file directly in your browser? You should see the text that is in the file, but no dialog will appear. If this works, then you can be sure that your <code>nim.js</code> file exists.</li>
<li>From the browser address bar, copy the address of your <code>nim.js</code> file. It should be something like: <code>file:///path/to/nim/gh-pages/js/nim.js</code></li>
<li>Copy the address for your <code>index.html</code> file from your browser's address bar. It should be something like: <code>file:///path/to/nim/gh-pages/index.html</code></li>
<li>Compare these two addresses, and delete from the first address everything on the left that is identical in both cases. In the example I give, this would leave you with <code>js/nim.js</code></li>
<li>Make sure that this is what you give as the value for the <code>src</code> attribute of the <code>script</code> element.</li>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p class="top">This tutorial shows you how to create a simple strategy game, where the computer will beat you every time, unless you know how to avoid the trap.</p>
<p class="top">You will be learning to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You will also learn how to use GitHub to save and display your work, and how to write code that tests your code. You don't need any previous knowledge of programming, but an inquisitive mind is a bonus.</p>
<p class="top aside info">You can see the completed game <a href="complete/">here</a>. You might like to try to beat the computer before you learn to write the code that will beat all other players.</p>

<h4>HTML</h4>
<p>HTML would be the food on your plate. HTML provides the content and the structure of the information in your web page.</p>
<p>A web page that just contains HTML can be informative, and can contain links to other pages.</p>
<h4>CSS</h4>
<p>CSS would be the way table is laid and the way the food is presented on your plate. CSS takes care of the colour, shape and position of the HTML elements. It's what gives the page its <span class="keyword">style</span>.</p>
<p>A web page that just contains CSS is like a deserted restaurant: neat and decorative surroundings, all prepared for something to happen.</p>
<h4>JavaScript</h4>
<p>JavaScript would be the animation and conversation. JavaScript is what makes the web page come to life, with interactions, animations, cause and effect. JavaScript can connect you to other internauts in other places, making the web a social place to be.</p>
<p>A web page that just contains JavaScript can create all the HTML and CSS that it needs.</p>
<h4>Git</h4>
<p>Git would be the event organizer, discreetly ensuring that everything is going to plan.</p>
<p>A web page does not need Git to manage it. When you first start creating web pages they will be simple enough for you to keep all your ideas tidy in your head as you are working. But as your experience and your initiatives grow, you will be happy to have Git to keep track of everything for you. Working with Git right from the beginning, on your first small projects, will give you confidence that you are ready to tackle larger projects.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, each page starts with the simplest instructions that you need to get to the next page. If these instructions work for you and you understand why they work, then there is no more to be said.</p>
<p>At the end of this starter section, you'll see a green box something like this:</p>
<p class="aside next">If you're ready to go on, click <span style="text-decoration: underline;">here</span> or on the Next arrow below, to go to the next page. If you want to know more, you can read the optional sections below.</p>
<p>If you can complete the entire tutorial without reading any of the optional sections below the green box, congratulations! We'd like to hear from you, so that we can feel good, too.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you read all the optional material carefully, and you are still unable to get the instructions to work for you, then please let us know. We'll do all we can to make the instructions and explanations better.</p>
<p>It would be helpful if you can tell us:</p>
<ul>
<li>What operating system you are using (eg. Windows 8.1, Mac 10.8.5 Mountain Lion, Ubuntu Utopic Unicorn...)</li>
<li>What browser you are testing your site with (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer 9...)</li>
<li>What text editor you are using to write your code. (If you are using <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text</a>, we may be able to be more helpful)</li>
<li>What version of Git you have running.</li>
<li>Where we can find your GitHub repository, so that we can see what you've done so far.</li>
<li>What's not working out for you...</li>
</ul>
