The NoteBook page needs four sections:

1. Text selected in main page
   Scrollable
   SelectWholeWords feature attached
   Ability to resize
2. Machine translation
   Choice of:
   * Google
   * Yandex
   * Bing
   * ...
   Connection to source tab
   Ability to resize
3. Top panels
4. Bottom panels

Dragging a panels icon up or down should make the complementary panel change height to match. If panel is almost full height, it should snap fully open, and the complementary panel should snap closed.

Icons for panels should be in a scrollable bar, which expands to fill the width available

Icon for active top panel should be on right; for active bottom panel on left, each with a shadow falling on the other content.

Panel may consist of:
* iFrame
* custom HTML

Options:
{ icon: <image>
, src: <URL if iFrame>
, html: <string>
, className: <string>
, js: <???>
, 
} 

A panel may display:
* an iFrame
* custom HTML


The p#original needs no buttons
p#translation needs:
* disclosure triangle
* goGoogle button

The hr element controls the height of the two translation paragraphs. It will collapse the taller field until it is the same height as the other, then collapse them both until they are 2 lines high. Pushing up further will hide the lower field, as if the disclosure triangle had been pressed (as a shortcut)

Pulling down will extend the open fields equally until either one is at its full height. In that case, the longer one will continue to grow until it reaches its full height. If the lower field is hidden, and the upper one is at full height and you continue to pull, the lower one will open to the same height (or shorter) as the upper one.

This snapping open may move the bottom of the lower field well past the mouse.

The lower panel will change in height to fill the space available. The maximum height of the upper fields will be the available height of the page, with the lower panels closed.

If both fields are scrollable, and a sync-scroll checkbox is checked, scrolling the upper one will 

As the translation div is extended, the ps may lose their scrollbars and get shorter. You could remove the scrollbars at the start and determine the full height, but there might be a flash. The alternative is to check if the clientHeight is greater than the scrollHeight.
