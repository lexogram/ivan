    <p>To weave its magic, the Annotations extension makes permanent records of your actions in a database on the server at lexogram.com.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It records the IP address that is assigned to you at the moment when you start using the Annotations extension</li>
      <li>It records what pages you have visited, and on what dates</li>
      <li>It stores a copy of the text of each page you visit</li>
      <li>It stores the personal notes that you make, and, with your permission, may share these notes anonymously with other people</li>
    </ul>
     <p>From this information, the server generates a profile of your language skills which may become more and more accurate the more you use the Annotations extensions and the Lexogram service.</p>
     <p>You may register with Lexogram using a unique username and password, so that you can keep track of your learning on different computers and share the same computer with different learners. You may provide an email address or a cell phone number, in order to reset your password. If you do so, then it will be technically possible to connect the activity associated with your account to you personally. Even if you don't register, your IP address may provide enough information to identify you.</p>
     <p>Lexogram uses this data only to provide you with a service that we hope you will find valuable. Lexogram does not provide any information concerning your activities to any third parties. Lexogram does its best to keep its servers secure from malicious attacks. However, Lexogram cannot guarantee that your personal use of the Annotations extension and the Lexogram infrastructure will remain private forever. By using the Annotations extension, you agree to refrain from any activity that you might regret, and never to hold Lexogram responsible in any way for anything that happens as a result of your use of the services that Lexogram provides.</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p class="top">This tutorial is currently a stub. When it is completed, it will show you how to use the APIs for Google Translate and Wiktionary to display third-party data in a <a href="../notebook/">Meteor web site</a>.</p>

  <div class="aside preview">In particular, you will be learning to:
    <ul>
      <li>Query Wiktionary for information on a word in any language</li>
      <li>Query Google Translate for a machine translation of a multi-word phrase</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
 <!--  <p class="aside support">If you have any difficulty anywhere in this tutorial, please <a href="https://github.com/lexogram/openbook/issues/new">tell us about it</a>, and we'll do our best to deal with it for you. Your questions and suggestions can help us make this tutorial better. -->
